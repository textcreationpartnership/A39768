         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is true, the writing of the <hi>firſt Letter</hi> had a very providential and unexpected riſe, with reſpect to a Friend who I knew had as great aſſiſtances in the way of means as any, ſuitable to his caſe, yet finding the weight &amp; exerciſe of his mind, have ſuch ſtrong influence to obſtruct that injoyment of ane intire reſt and fixedneſs of his Faith, which is the Chriſtians Allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wance, I was preſt to offer ſome thoughts, in a directive manner for being a Helper to his Joy, and now if by ſuch a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence through the good Hand of the Lord, this might be ſerviceable to any in ſuch a

            <p>An exceſſive deſire in ſuch an <hi>Epiſtola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> way to ſpeak things in as few Words I could poſſibly, I fear may at the first view render ſomethings more dark.

But on ſo great a ſubject I muſt go a little out of an Epiſtola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way both in the method and meaſure; and what in the firſt place I would ſpeak to is this, that I durſt offer nothing to divert, or take off any thing of the ſuitable weight of ſo choiſe ane exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe as is ſo rare in theſe times, under which your ſpirit is ſo much preſſed, but were it needful rather to add thereto on theſe grounds.</p>

            <p>1. That it is ſurely the greateſt deſigne can fall under the conſideration of mankind for men to have ſuch ane aſſurance of divine truth, as can both anſwer the greatneſſe of that adventure they have thereon, and can fully quiet and comfort the ſoul when viſible refuges, and humane aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſeem wholly to ſuccumbe; and ſince we muſt either have ane entire reſt, and ſettlement herein, or none at all, I know not how to judge otherwiſe of that ordinar ſence, and implicit credit on ſo great ane account as this, then as a degree, and evidence of the ſad Atheiſm of this day we are now in. 2. If ever I knew any thing of the way of God in truth, I muſt reckon this as the higheſt enjoiment of a Chriſtian, where the <hi>ſecurity, and quiet of his mind,</hi> upon the <hi>truth,</hi> anſwers to ſo great a <hi>Revelation</hi> hereof, and to know he is thus on ſure terms with God, on the whole adventures of his truſt; when it is ſo near to adventure on the triall thereof in the laſt <hi>deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of there eternal ſtate; yea when thus they know how to enjoy a promiſe for there ſupport in this ſtate of warefare, under a <hi>long deferred hope,</hi> tho the whole courſe of providence would ſeem to controul the ſame, knowing the ground they <hi>anchor</hi> on cannot poſſibly faill: ſince this ſhould be the <hi>ultimate Inquiry</hi> about the <hi>event,</hi> that it is ſure they have a <hi>divine teſtimonie</hi> to warrant there confidence, and if the higheſt joy and comfort o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31860:5"/> in a <hi>line of mutual reſpect,</hi> which in that manner runs through the ſame, as ane <hi>entry</hi> aright upon one <hi>ſtep,</hi> muſt make way to render a further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe clear and unavoidable, ſo here I muſt judge.</p>
            <p>1. That a Chriſtian ſhould once make it ſuch a <hi>proper and ſolemn</hi> buſineſs, and work by it ſelf, to attain a ſolid founding, and ſettlement of their <hi>faith on the truth,</hi> and to ſiſt his ſoul in ſuch a manner, as if he were then to enter on the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian profeſſion, without reſpect to <hi>example, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation,</hi> or influence of any humane authority, or whatever any external motives could have weight herein, ſince in a caſe of that high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern men ſhould in the greateſt receſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of ſpirit, have ſome diſtinct ſpecial time, ſuch as may be matter after of ſweet reflexion to them, how they did then prove themſelves, with reſpect to ſo high and <hi>diſcriminating a profeſſion,</hi> from the reſidue of the world, and did thus with full inward conſent join in with the truth <hi>purely on its own evidence,</hi> as though there were none of that profeſſion in the bounds and place they lived in.</p>
            <p>2. As the <hi>naturall order of things</hi> should require that the <hi>foundation</hi> be ſure laid, ere we begin to <hi>build;</hi> ſo is it ſure that the firſt <hi>entry</hi> on ſerious Religion, muſt be on the <hi>Faith of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and exiſtence,</hi> and that men have aſſuredly <hi>a God</hi> to truſt to, and to make them happy, as

            <p>4.

To ſee how high a value, and account God put upon that one <hi>promiſe,</hi> by ſo long a delay, and procraſtination of the ſame, as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31860:9"/> worthy of the Churches waiting, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the ſame, <hi>for 4000. Years.</hi> 5. This enquiry muſt lye here, to ſee the firſt <hi>entry of the Chriſtian Faith</hi> on the world in its <hi>preciſe time, and date,</hi> and how ſuch a light did not shine on <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in the ſtate of perfection, whilſt they ſtood in a ſtate of tryal upon a perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their God, but with the falling doun of that diſmal night of there fall, did the glory of this light firſt dawn (that there might be no utter darkneſs in the ſtate of <hi>mankind</hi> as in that of the <hi>fallen angels,</hi>) whereby the final condemnatory ſentence on the one, and releef for the other were made known, and promulgate together, and the room of the <hi>first Adam,</hi> filled up with a higher glory by the <hi>ſecond.</hi> 6. How this bleſſed light (tho with a <hi>gradual increaſe,</hi>) did never ceaſe to shine on this world ſince it began to dawn, nor hath there ever ceaſed a peculiar people in a <hi>Church relation,</hi> who were diſtinct, and ſeparate from the reſidue of men, whoſe profeſſion was founded in the alone faith of a redeemer, ſo as one day hath not been, ſince the firſt <hi>entry</hi> of that promiſe, wherein, the <hi>ſun</hi> did shine on the earth, when the <hi>ſun of righteouſneſs</hi> did not shine alſo by vital influences of light, and power, and where the <hi>Churches head,</hi> had not ſome part of his <hi>body</hi> here to converſe with as the peculiar objects of his complaiſance, and love, and did <hi>rejoice in the habitable parts of the earth;</hi> tho that ſome <hi>ages</hi>

But this <hi>enquiry</hi> goes further, to ſee theſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of <hi>evidence,</hi> and divine condeshendence, which was given to ſupport the faith of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, on that great promiſe even by an <hi>ocular</hi> diſcovery, to the outward ſence, as in the whole <hi>frame</hi> and ſucceſſive courſe of the <hi>legal ſacrifices,</hi> and theſe numerous <hi>figures,</hi> and <hi>types</hi> in that long preparatory ſervice; wherein he did not let his people feed on aſshes, naked shadows, and where nothing was inept or uſleſs, but was expreſly ſignificative, of that higheſt <hi>myſtery of Christ,</hi> and could poſſibly bear no other ſence, or intent; and ſince the whole ſtreſs of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith</hi> lyes upon this <hi>one promiſe,</hi> or what can make the ſtate of man valeuable, in any true enjoiement of his life here, its on this <hi>head</hi> should be ſett the firſt ſettlement of our faith; for I know no releef, but in a <hi>promiſed redeemer,</hi> and if it were not for the <hi>old Teſtament,</hi> I could not poſſibly be a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> if the morning, and growing-light, of that glorious myſtery, had not gone before its meridian hight, and as a clear conduct to the next ſtep, I shall enter on</p>
            <p>A III. INQUIRY, to know that this <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental promiſe of a redemers coming to the world
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31860:10"/> is aſſuredly made good,</hi> and is no more a <hi>matter of faith,</hi> but of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> that its ſure our eyes ſee ſuch a <hi>day,</hi> and long expected <hi>period of time,</hi> and can be no dark or doubtful thing now to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, but may enter on its profeſſion in the open light; but to clear how with the ſame evidence of the certainty of the promiſe, we may ſee its performance alſo, and if we be ſure of the one that it is not poſſible to be in queſtion about the other, is thus viſible. 1. Becauſe we muſt then part with the <hi>old Teſtament,</hi> and ceaſe to credit its <hi>divinity,</hi> and no comfort could be from the ſame; if it had yet failed in this great event, and what is the main intent thereof for if the <hi>promiſed Meſſias were yet to come,</hi> I could then look for none, ſince all theſe <hi>proper circumſtances,</hi> which are ſo expreſly foretold, whereby to know and diſcern him, muſt be wholly made void, and ane utter <hi>nullity</hi> should be in that <hi>faith.</hi> 2. Becauſe I could not poſſibly look for the accomplishment of that <hi>promiſe,</hi> according to the whole tenor of the <hi>old Teſtament,</hi> in another way then what we have hereof in the revelation of the Ghoſpel; yea were it ſuppoſable that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> were yet to come; is is ſure I could only look and expect for his acting the ſame part and in the ſame appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. 3. Let us but compare the <hi>antient creed</hi> of the Church herein, with that which is ours, now under the diſpenſation of the <hi>Ghoſpel,</hi> and ſee whither they be not entirely on in ſubſtance,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31860:11"/> and center in the ſame <hi>redeemer,</hi> with this varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only, that the one was on the credit and aſſurance of what was <hi>promiſed,</hi> and the other on the certainty of its <hi>accomplishment,</hi> ſo as that may be as applicable, to <hi>Moſes, Iſaia,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> with other of the Prophets, as to the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> what is ſpoke by <hi>John Chap. 20: v. 31. But theſe are written that ye might beleeve that Jeſus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that beleeving you might have life through his name;</hi> where we may ſee there could be no humane contrivance, in this joint concurring for the ſame end, and by the ſame ſpirit: but yet more ſpecialy lyes the weight of this <hi>enquiry,</hi> to ſee, 1. how the moſt ſolemn times of the <hi>old Testament</hi> was ſtill a <hi>waiting,</hi> and <hi>expecting time,</hi> and that their higheſt enjoiments, lay in hope of that glory to be revealed in after ages, when the ſeal should be taken off that great <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

How the breaking up of Ghoſpel, and its firſt entry on the world, had its <hi>preciſe time,</hi> and <hi>date,</hi> as that which was ſo abſolutly neceſſare, for a more clear ſettling of the Chriſtian Faith, this being a <hi>matter of fact,</hi> and of the higheſt import that ever was, and was ane <hi>external object of Senſe,</hi> in the view of the World, which laid an inevitable conſtraint, on the whole Chriſtian Church, then to have it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31860:11"/> keept clear, and under the moſt exact and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual circumſtances. 3, As <hi>Iſraels</hi> coming out of <hi>Egypt in a typical</hi> reſpect, was a <hi>night,</hi> and <hi>time of ſuch great obſervation,</hi> and that the Lord did put hereon, ſo ſpecial a weight, with reſpect to the punctual and preciſe <hi>time</hi> hereof; ſo was this in a more eminent way, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e matter of higheſt regard, <hi>when and in what time, the great univerſal good, and bleſſing of mankind, our bleſſed redeemer,</hi> was revealed unto the World, which should begin a <hi>new week,</hi> and that <hi>ſolemn Epocha,</hi> whence wee reckon the Churches entry on the higheſt glory of time, and on a <hi>new ſtate.</hi> 4. Hereon hath that ſolemn obſervation of the <hi>first day of the week,</hi> as the <hi>Lords day</hi> both its ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, and right; tho it might ſeem not poſſible this could ever come under forgetfulneſs when it was thus fixed, upon the higheſt certainty, and <hi>preciſe time,</hi> both of the <hi>ſufferings, and reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, of the Lord,</hi> in matter of fact; as that <hi>day</hi> and <hi>time</hi> was, which had a <hi>glory</hi> put thereon, that none elſe could poſſibly claim, and no time ever ſince that glas, ſett up to their creation, was like unto this, yea which was wholly impoſſible to fix the Chriſtian Church on the obſervation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of otherways, but that this was ſo publick and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in the view of the world, and had ſo great a weight on the primitive Chriſtians, then, when theſe <hi>morning stars ſung together,</hi> and <hi>the Sons of God shouted for joy,</hi> at the firſt entry of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31860:12"/> this <hi>new World,</hi> and it may be ſpecially remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, that our Lord did the leſs inforce the ſame in an <hi>authoritative way,</hi> both to try and truſt the love of his people herein, that what he had done for them, put ſo ſtrong ane enforcment and impoſition, to a frequent and ſolemn remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of this bleſſed day from internal motives; and tho its divine authority be clear, yet the leſs is of <hi>poſitive inſtitution</hi> this way, the more ſtrenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning might it be to our <hi>faith,</hi> and more excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo for our <hi>love</hi> herein, were it ſeriouſly conſidered, 5. And of what weight ſhould this <hi>enquiry</hi> be ſtill on mens ſpirits, that our hope leans novv no more on a <hi>promiſe,</hi> on which the Saints of old did both live and die, when this makes ſo eſſential a change in the Chriſtian Faith, that vvhat ane <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſaved by cannot poſſibly ſave us, to <hi>beleeve in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer to come,</hi> which would now be abſolutly <hi>mortall,</hi> nay not in <hi>generall terms</hi> to beleeve that he is come, but to knovv and be ſure, that <hi>this is he whom the Fathers ſealed,</hi> and <hi>ſent unto the World,</hi> and he alone who in the dayes of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate ſuffered at Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A IV. INQUIRY, which ſuitably followes here, is to look in upon the <hi>glory of that time under the new Teſtament,</hi> vvhich vvas peculiarly reſerved thereto; and on theſe <hi>publick declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſigns</hi> to the World, whereby our <hi>Redeemer was declared to be the Son of God, with power,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:31860:12"/> and by the <hi>ſpirit of Holineſs,</hi> ſo as it may be ſaid the Lord did then <hi>ſet up Signs and Wonders to this very day,</hi> with a more eminent luſtre then theſe at the Churches outgoing from <hi>Egypt;</hi> but ſince in the <hi>times</hi> we live in, you may find more to ſhake and ſtagger then to ſtrengthen your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the way of truth, when it is not in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare degree, that a <hi>reall Apoſtacy</hi> may be ſeen from the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> this day in the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> whilſt that choice ſpirit of the <hi>Bereans</hi> ſeems rarely to be found in the earth, I ſhall touch but a little this <hi>great ſubject in ſome inſtances,</hi> wherein our <hi>blest Redeemer after his Aſcenſion</hi> hath ſtill made himſelf <hi>viſible</hi> before the World in the glory of his divine Power, and are of ſuch kind, as no diſtance of time can take off that ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable evidence of the ſame from a ſerious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as if they were ſtill preſent.</p>
            <p>1. That tho <hi>in his bodily preſence,</hi> ſince he left the World, he is no <hi>object</hi> any more of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſenſe, yet hath he been no leſs <hi>viſible</hi> in his goings forth to <hi>conquer and eſtablish a Kingdom to himſelf out of all Nations, Tongues and Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> even to the utmoſt parts of the earth; and ſince I know you can improve ſome <hi>Reflections</hi> on this Head, bejond what I can ſpeak thereon, I ſhall the more briefly point at a few. 1. That it is knowen and ſure, how moſt of the habitable World beſides <hi>Judaea,</hi> was in times paſt <hi>Pagan,</hi> and a place of <hi>horror</hi> and <hi>darkneſs,</hi> and theſe parts
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:31860:13"/> we now live in were once the <hi>dark places of the earth, full of the Habitations of Cruelty,</hi> where our <hi>Ancestors</hi> of whom we are come, did Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the <hi>Gods of the Heathens.</hi> 2. It is evident and undeniable in the matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> that within leſs then <hi>ſixty Years after the Aſcenſion of the Lord,</hi> the viſible extent of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> among the Nations which had been then <hi>Heathen,</hi> did exceed what it is this day; and ſince any <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinar effect</hi> when it comes in our ſight, should cauſe a deep Inquiry upon the <hi>cauſe</hi> hereof, is not this a matter of the higheſt concern, that ever was, even in the preſent day to be taken up with that made then ſo ſtupendious a change on the face of mankind, and was as the bringing forth of a new World. 3. And here is it poſſible to queſtion, that this wonderful thing which did ſo viſibly then change the whole face of the earth, was by the alone <hi>evidence and vertue of Sacred Truth,</hi> and the <hi>pure Revelation of Christ</hi> in the Myſtery of his Death and Sufferings, wherein no humane Power could boaſt that their <hi>Arm</hi> or <hi>Sword</hi> did bring this about; as I know it will be ſweet and convincing thus to ſee under what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, the <hi>Christian Church</hi> was both planted and propogate in the earth and moſt ſavage parts thereof, ſo that whatever reſpect <hi>Princes</hi> and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Powers have given to the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> yet is it fully demonſtrable that it's <hi>true interest and conquest</hi> was never beholden to <hi>humane aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:31860:13"/> or that any temporal inducements made way thereto, but when the World begun to ſmile moſt in the <hi>primitive times,</hi> then alſo did the Glory and Luſtre of the Chriſtian Religion begin to darken, and decline. 4. As it was ſurely reſerved to the <hi>Ghoſpel State of the Church,</hi> to be <hi>the Theater of the greatest Wonders both of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Grace,</hi> bejond all that had been known to the World before, and that in the times of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> theſe great things which should be matter of higheſt obſervation, and out of the ordinare road of Gods dealing with his Church then was to be expected, ſo you can ſee with full evidence, that this <hi>great and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinare appearance of God unto men,</hi> had been never known on the earth before, or any ſuch outgoing of his Power ſince the beginning of time, which was only reſerved to follow the day of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> as the firſt entry of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>2. But it is yet a further <hi>Inquiry</hi> should be made on this <hi>Head,</hi> to ſee not only the <hi>outgoing of the Lord Jeſus in the Glory of his Power ſince his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion,</hi> for ſetting up his <hi>viſible Kingdom</hi> in the World, and extent of the Chriſtian Profeſſion, but in the <hi>reality of that vital influence on the ſouls of men,</hi> with ſo great and wonderful a change thus made on them from the reſidue of mankind. This, I doubt not, will be a ſubject of great thoughts and <hi>reflection</hi> to you, and should be a matter of higher concern to any of a ſerious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, then the temporal intereſt and transactions, which are about the greateſt Kingdoms on the earth. 1. To ſee how no reality in nature, or the moſt viſible objects of ſenſe, can be more ſure, then that under the times of the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> there hath been <hi>innumerable example of the truth and power of Holineſs,</hi> ſucceſſively from one age to another, in whom it might be no more diſcernable, that they walked in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and power of a <hi>humane ſoull,</hi> then that they did truly walk before men in the <hi>light and power of Chriſtianity,</hi> and under that viſible influence of <hi>inward Grace,</hi> as all might ſee to be above the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31860:14"/> poſſibility of <hi>natural cauſes.</hi> 2. If this were more deeply ſearch'd into, to ſee what does eſtentially belong to the <hi>frame and conſtitution of one reall Chriſtian,</hi> and what a marvelous Power muſt be put forth herein, it could not but be in another manner affecting, and afford <hi>a Seall to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith,</hi> as does exceed the greateſt <hi>external Miracles;</hi> when it's ſure one <hi>example</hi> of ſuch, who is truly <hi>converted</hi> by <hi>grace,</hi> and made partaker of the <hi>Divine nature,</hi> is ſo ſtupendious a work as does far exceed both the power and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Angels,</hi> yea that the <hi>Glory of the Godhead</hi> does more eminently ſhine forth in the <hi>first frame,</hi> in the <hi>conduct,</hi> and <hi>perſiting of one Christian,</hi> then either in the <hi>first frame of man</hi> in his ſtate of perfection, or of the <hi>illuminate Angels,</hi> ſince this is to make <hi>Saints of Sinners,</hi> to turn ſuch from a ſtate of enmity, and inbred oppoſition to the Holy God to be Lovers of him, and ſubdue their ſoulls in that manner, as with inward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light can make them part with what was their predominant and endeared Intereſt, and what hath been as their right hand and eye. This is one of the great diſcoveries of the <hi>Ghoſpel</hi> to let us ſee how one <hi>converted Christian</hi> is a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> then a <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ordinare Profeſſors</hi> hereof, and may fully ſilence ſuch a <hi>Question,</hi> why it is, that the <hi>Saints are not more numerous in the World,</hi> comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the great bulk of mankind, yea with theſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31860:15"/> who go under the Chriſtian Profeſſion, when It might be rather juſt matter of wonder to ſee that ſuch <hi>numerous Examples</hi> yet are to be found of this kind in the earth, of whom each, is <hi>one of the greatest of the Works of God,</hi> and infinitely becoming the exceeding greatneſs of his Power put forth herein; yea are ſuch <hi>Examples,</hi> where the Truth and Excellency of <hi>Grace</hi> does in any eminency shine forth, as may juſtly ſupply the Room of <hi>Miracles,</hi> which were given in the <hi>first times</hi> to be confirming to the <hi>Christian Faith;</hi> that theſe hath aſſuredly been, and I hope are this day not a few, who doe with deſire choiſe to preferr their <hi>Services for God,</hi> to the greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts &amp; enjoyments of this earth, and are helped not only to keep ground, but gain, under ſuch <hi>conflicts and aſſaults</hi> in their ſpiritual courſe, as go above the <hi>poſſibility of nature</hi> to withſtand. 3. And what a wonder may one Chriſtian be, who does converſe with God here on the earth, both to himſelf and others, who hath ſuch near enjoyments of the <hi>divine preſence,</hi> hath ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonishing hopes, hath ever the <hi>Elect Angels</hi> to be both their guard and obſervers; and tho the <hi>Saints above</hi> return no more to converſe with us, yet is it not queſtionable, but that they have the ſame <hi>proſpect of the outgoings of providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Saints yet militant,</hi> &amp; as to their <hi>ſervices, trialls, and victories,</hi> which the <hi>Angels</hi> have to whom they are <hi>now made equal,</hi> and in the ſame

            <p>3.

And that it's ſure there was no perſonated ſhew in theſe unexpreſſible ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of theſe Saints for Chriſt, nor did the World in ſuch a perſecuting work, through moſt of the times of <hi>the New Teſtament</hi> conflict with a ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:31860:16"/> exceed the ſphere and poſſibility of nature; it hath thus the moſt full and undeniable evidence; nor vvere it poſſible that the <hi>most excellent of the earth</hi> ſhould upon choiſe act ſuch a part of imbracing death under the greateſt torments, when their life and the enjoyments of time was ſet before them, if they had not been acted by a <hi>Divine Spirit,</hi> and knew theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible comforts and joy, which was then given in for their ſupport, and matter of preſent ſenſe, and fealing, to be no illuſion of mind here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. 3. It is on this <hi>Head</hi> you can ſee and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare what a difference was betwixt the <hi>Legal Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices under the Old Testament,</hi> which were <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative and typical,</hi> and theſe <hi>freewil offerings</hi> and <hi>oblations of love by Martyrdom</hi> under the Ghoſpel, which were offered up as a publick <hi>confirmatory Seall to the Divinity of Christ,</hi> and that the <hi>deſire of all Nations</hi> was now come; how the one did in a myſtery, and under a vaile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Churches Faith of a <hi>Redeemer to come,</hi> the other with the higheſt evidence of power did atteſt his being come, and <hi>ſeall this Teſtimony with their Blood,</hi> the one from a temporary and <hi>poſitive Inſtitution,</hi> the other not only under a conſtraint of light, but an <hi>impoſition of love, by the Spirit of Christ, and of Glory resting on them</hi> was thus offered up, and as to the <hi>quality</hi> of theſe Sacrifices: how great a difference was herein? the one only of <hi>Beasts,</hi> wherein the Lord would
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:31860:16"/> admit no humane Sacrifice to be <hi>typical,</hi> but now after the great <hi>propitiation was offered up,</hi> theſe <hi>Sacrifices of Love</hi> was not only of <hi>men,</hi> but of the moſt <hi>excellent of humane race,</hi> who in purity and holineſs were the greateſt ornament of the earth in their day, the <hi>number</hi> whereof ſince the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, is of that extent as can be only known by him who <hi>counts the number of the Stars,</hi> ſo innumerable have they been; yea as to the <hi>expence</hi> and allowance of ſo high a ſervice, men can not exerce reaſon, and not ſee it did not only anſwer but exceed the meaſure of their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and how theſe <hi>Flames of Love</hi> in which they were offered, was more prevalent then theſe of the <hi>Fire.</hi> 4. And is it not matter of ſweet <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection</hi> herein, that as the <hi>incomprehenſible Love of God</hi> unto man is the <hi>admiration of the elect An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> ſo this illuſtrious teſtimony of <hi>humane Love unto God,</hi> is not only made conſpicous to them, but is both the foile and torment of the <hi>Powers of Darkneſs,</hi> to ſee ſuch a triumph of the Power of Grace amongſt <hi>men</hi> here on the earth made vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; wherein my ſoull deſires to rejoice that as our <hi>blest Head</hi> hath aſſigned ſuch a meaſure of his <hi>ſufferings, as a teſtimony to the truth to be filled up</hi> by his People, under the times of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> and to take a higher tryall of the <hi>love of mankind</hi> herein to him, then he would take even of the love of the <hi>bleſſed Angels,</hi> ſo hath this <hi>Teſtimony</hi> with the cleareſt and undeniable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence been made known.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:31860:17"/>
            <p>But there is a 4. <hi>ſpecial Inſtance</hi> of the out goings of our <hi>Redeemer in a viſible diſcovery of himſelf to the World ſince his Aſcenſion,</hi> which is in the <hi>ſucceſſive courſe of the Ghoſpel amongst the Nations,</hi> and theſe remarkable Periods of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and ſetting of this bleſſed light on different places of the earth; on which a few things I would ſpeak for your further clearing herein. 1. That it is undeniable, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> have their <hi>appointed times,</hi> which muſt be <hi>fulfilled, Luke 21: v.</hi> 24. wherein the <hi>fulneſs</hi> thereof muſt be brought in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11: 25. which Scriptures bear expreſly the ſame intent, but it's now many ages, ſince theſe <hi>times of the Gentiles</hi> hath been fulfilled both in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> where the Ghoſpel in its courſe at the <hi>Sun,</hi> hath had its firſt upbreaking, hen in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and its progreſs to the <hi>Weſt and Northern Parts of the Earth.</hi> 2. That it is clear, theſe <hi>times of the Gentiles,</hi> and the <hi>fulneſs</hi> thereof, is to be only underſtood in a <hi>diſtinct and ſeparate State</hi> from the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo that as the <hi>Jewish Church</hi> once had their proper <hi>times</hi> allotted them in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate ſtate from the whole reſidue of the World, ſo have the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had their <hi>times under the New Teſtament,</hi> peculiar to them only; and the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God</hi> hath there expreſly ſhewed, that this great Revolution in the incalling of the <hi>Jews</hi> to the Chriſtian Faith, is not to be expected until theſe <hi>times</hi> be once accomplish'd, when there ſhall be then no more diſtinguishing names of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:31860:17"/> 
               <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> and no proper intereſt owned by them in a divided way as formerly, but that the <hi>Lord shall be one, and his name one,</hi> in that bleſſed frame of his <hi>univerſal Kingdom;</hi> it's in the faith hereof my ſoull does reſt. 3. How far theſe <hi>ſett times of the Gentiles,</hi> and of the coming in of the <hi>fulneſs</hi> thereof, be accomplisht, will in due time be diſcloſed, and with humble ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety we muſt judge hereof, but it may be ſo far evident, that then ſome ſingular withdrawing of the Spirit of God in the Power of the Ghoſpel will be diſcernable from the <hi>Gentile Church,</hi> with the shutting up of theſe times, and a very low ebb, &amp; great darkneſs on the whole <hi>Weſtern Churches,</hi> before the riſing again of the Glory of that Light, and return of the <hi>Sun</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt</hi> again; and how it ſtands now with the publick State of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Churches</hi> any where, you can more fitly judge and diſcern.</p>
            <p>There is a V. INQ: yet for a more full ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> that I would ſeriou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly commend, which is on the <hi>whole frame and nature of that pure and excellent Religion we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, and the intrinſick perfections thereof;</hi> which beſide the <hi>Authority of divine Inſtitution,</hi> you may ſee <hi>founded in the immutable nature and eſſence of the ſame,</hi> and thus have your ſoull rais'd to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and rejoice in that <hi>God,</hi> whoſe <hi>Excellencies</hi> are with that evidence herein diſplay'd, as it is not poſſible for men to be more bleſt in the earth,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:31860:18"/> then in this way. It is here I may ſay hath my ſpirit been oft drawn forth to ſee with admiration the <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Perfections of the Moral Part of our Religion,</hi> ſo that if men would ſee in a true mirror what the <hi>Hoiy inviſible God is like in his bleſſed Reſemblance,</hi> lo here is it clearly preſented to them, and ſince any diſcovery of ſuch a <hi>Light,</hi> I know you prefer much above the <hi>Light of the Sun</hi> on this earth, as that alone which renders the ſtate of man to be deſirable; I would touch this a little as may afford ſome reflections o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſo great a <hi>Head,</hi> which may be, in the very notion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, rarely the ſubject of mens thoughts. 1. That which is of the higheſt concern in the <hi>first place,</hi> to fix your ſpirit on, is to ſee in what <hi>manner the great deſign of the Ghoſpel, for the ſaving of lost man is layd,</hi> in that myſtery of the <hi>Humiliation and Sufferings of our Redeemer,</hi> and how this way the <hi>Majeſty of God would take ſatisfaction to himſelf, and his infinite Juſtice, by himſelf,</hi> which otherwiſe was not attainable; I know that to look in an ordinare manner hereon, might be ready to ſhake your ſpirit with aſtonishment, that the <hi>Divine Majeſty</hi> should aſcribe to himſelf ſuch an <hi>abaſement,</hi> as to join in the <hi>humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in an union with the Deity,</hi> yea thus to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the higheſt ignominy of <hi>ſufferings,</hi> that could poſſibly be allotted to the moſt <hi>Criminal</hi> amongſt men, but it's in ſuch a choiſe enquiry you will find your eſtablishment and admiration
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:31860:18"/> grow together, and thus have a share in the ſame exerciſe of the <hi>Angels</hi> on this <hi>ſubject,</hi> who <hi>look in hereon with joy and wondriug.</hi> 2. You muſt ſee herewith alſo, how of <hi>ſuch a nature is this bleſſed Religion</hi> you enjoy, as can never be <hi>known or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by men until it be enlivened from Heaven,</hi> or be poſſibly taken up or underſtood in a <hi>natural way, as humane ſciences are,</hi> but muſt have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>teacher</hi> then men, and a faculty and power <hi>ſupernatural,</hi> to know and diſcern the <hi>things of God</hi> herein; yea how in its vvhole <hi>couſtitution</hi> it is made up of theſe great <hi>Excellencies of Light and Life,</hi> which do inſeperably meet here; whoſe <hi>evidence lyes in ſeeing,</hi> and not in report or a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked teſtimony to the ear, but is in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the <hi>Sun</hi> is made known by its own beams and light; and it were indeed ſad, if the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs did not this day shine with as full evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to men in this Lower Orb of the Ghoſpel, as the Meridian Daylight is to our natural ſenſe,</hi> to let us ſee both the greatneſs and ſecurity of our hope, yea that we are deſigned for an <hi>Eternal State,</hi> &amp; muſt therefore ſeek after a <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> as will laſt as long as our <hi>immortal ſouls</hi> that cannot perish. 3. But this will neceſſarily carry your thoughts further, to ſee how the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> does not only with full evidence <hi>manifest it ſelf by its own Light,</hi> but does the more brightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the <hi>oppoſition of darkneſs,</hi> and of <hi>every falſe way and pretence of Religion,</hi> and how the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:31860:19"/> 
               <hi>eſſential Differences betwixt the ſame</hi> are as fully e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident and viſible, as is betwixt the day and night, betwixt truth and falſhood, which are founded in the immutable nature of theſe things themſelves; and how <hi>the way of truth</hi> hath ſurely that <hi>vital air</hi> and <hi>fragrancy</hi> herewith, and ſuch a <hi>native luſtre,</hi> as is no more poſſible for <hi>humane art</hi> and invention to repreſent, then it were to draw a <hi>living man</hi> on a broad, or for one to draw forth the <hi>natural ſent of a Violet or Roſe.</hi> 4. It is here alſo you will find it ſpecially ſtrengthning to ſee the <hi>nature of theſe ſervices,</hi> which belong to the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> how here is nothing that is <hi>ſervile,</hi> or to affright any to come under ſuch a bleſſed <hi>yoke,</hi> which in its whole <hi>conſtitution</hi> is ſo full of a Holy ſweetneſs to allure, and impoſeth no <hi>Law of Bondage</hi> on the ſpirits of men, but what hath inward motives to render it both eaſy and comforting, does preſcribe no duty to be a task, and no ſervice but from love, and where the <hi>Moral Law is purely Evangelick,</hi> and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to us in the <hi>Hands of Mediator,</hi> yea of ſuch a <hi>nature</hi> is the whole obedience and ſervices of the Chriſtian Faith, as you may clearly ſee that duty on the <hi>matter,</hi> is not anough, where there is not a ſuitableneſs thereto in the <hi>manner</hi> of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ſame, that the <hi>leading motives and principles</hi> be purely for God; nor can the way of his ſervice be truly followed until his revealed Law have an internal efficacy on mens ſoull, and

It is here you may ſee likewiſe, how the whole <hi>Conſtitutions of the Chriſtian Faith</hi> are ſuch, as its <hi>highest Glory and Triumph</hi> here on the earth, is ſtill moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicous in the <hi>darkest night of Affliction and Trouble,</hi> and in the moſt remarkable depths thereof; this is ſurely a great diſcovery, and a ſtrange riddle to nature, which ſtands in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs oppoſition to the univerſal ſence of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, how this way the Lord does put the higheſt honor on men here on the earth, in the <hi>paſſive valour of Chriſtianity,</hi> yea thus puts the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing marks of reſpect on his <hi>choiſest Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is a VI. INQUIRY, I muſt further direct you to without which no <hi>evidences</hi> of the truth, can be truly effectual on your ſoull; which is on that <hi>wonderful part of Chriſtianity,</hi> that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:31860:20"/> lyes in the truth of <hi>inward experience, and is the very life and ſoull of our Religion.</hi> The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch a <hi>Subject</hi> makes it more difficult to ſpeak hereon, now in a short <hi>Epiſtolary Diſcourſe,</hi> but it shall be in as few words as is poſſible, only to point at ſuch things as may tend to more clear and ſolid impreſſions of this <hi>Myſtery,</hi> and make way for your own ſearch and tryall of the ſame; and I hope I may ſay they are things, which have not been taken on report. or have found it eaſy to be ſatisfyed herein, as to a full acquieſcence in the truth and aſſurance thereof; but it's to a few ſpecial <hi>ends</hi> I would refer your ſerious improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this <hi>great Inquiry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. For this <hi>end</hi> that a clear <hi>notion and Idaea of ſpiritual experience of the things of God,</hi> may be more deaply ſetled on your ſpirit, and how in theſe reſpects it is to be underſtood: 1. that God hath directed his <hi>Sacred Truth</hi> unto men not only for <hi>trust,</hi> but for <hi>tryall,</hi> which is a <hi>tryall</hi> of that nature, &amp; ſtated on ſo great and wonderful things, that the whole <hi>vital part</hi> of Religion should be a ſtrange and dark thing until you be once entred hereon; they <hi>are bleſſed who beeleve and have not yet ſeen</hi> what relates to the <hi>State of Glory above,</hi> but they can never be bleſt who do not <hi>ſee,</hi> as <hi>well as beleeve</hi> what belongs to the <hi>life and enjoyments of Grace within time, in the truth of inward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</hi> 2.

               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:31860:20"/> which is ane <hi>acquaintance</hi> of that concern, as the Lord hath laid over the weight of his peoples ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual joy, refreſhment, and ſupport, whilſt they are within time, on the ſame; and is the firſt <hi>entry</hi> on <hi>converſe with ſpirits,</hi> and with <hi>God, the Father of ſpirits,</hi> which ſhall be <hi>eternal.</hi> 3. It is ſuch, as hath a diſtinct <hi>evidence</hi> from any <hi>moral influence</hi> by the Word or <hi>light</hi> to the judgment; and is the proper object of ſpiritual ſenſe, which no <hi>humane power,</hi> or <hi>Angels</hi> can impart, but <hi>God</hi> hath reſerved only to himſelf, who can only make his <hi>own love known</hi> to the ſoul, and no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, or teſtimony of men can doe. 4.

                  </gap>l part</hi> in the truth of <hi>inward experience,</hi> which is his peculiar <hi>interest</hi> and <hi>talent,</hi> and it's ſure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing does more work on mens ſouls; and afford more ſweet thoughts then what this way is made there own, to know in themſelves the <hi>internal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations</hi> of the truth they profeſſe, in the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> thereof; and to know what great things hath paſſed between God and their own ſoul, and what remarkable times hath gone over
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:31860:21"/> them, and ſpecial remarkes herein of divine conduct, and his immediate appearance, in the courſe of their life. 6. It is of that <hi>kind</hi> as none poſſibly can take on truſt, from the teſtimony of others, or will ſatisfy without perſonal tryall, tho this be more known to ſuch who <hi>by reaſon of uſe have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern good and evil Hebr.</hi> 5: 14. 7. But whatever ſingular uſe is hereby to the ſupport of our Faith, yet are they not the grounds thereof; ſince theſe are only, what God hath <hi>ſpoke in his word,</hi> and not what he hath <hi>done in his work;</hi> tho they are at a great loſs who have begun late to obſerve the ſame: it is true the greateſt <hi>talent,</hi> which is by <hi>inward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,</hi> and <hi>experiments</hi> which have been moſt deeply affecting in the preſent time; does not abide in the ſame <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and <hi>fealing,</hi> and mayly as a <hi>dead ſtock</hi> upon a Chriſtians hand, without freſh, and immediate ſupplies; yet are they ſtill the ſame in the truth thereof, and does ever evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, how far the enjoiment of grace, and of a ſpiritual eſtate does exceed the greateſt enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of nature. 8. This alſo muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not only by the teſtimony of inward ſenſe, but what comes under the moſt <hi>exact,</hi> and <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious tryall,</hi> as to the principles it leans on, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, there could be no true enjoiment of the ſame, if they were not as fully ſatisfied of holding their <hi>experience by right, as in poſseſſion,</hi> and that theſe great things are no shadowes or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:31860:21"/> but what is of the higheſt <hi>truth, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> and <hi>reality.</hi> 9. It is ſure that God is not known in the earth, or enjoyed in <hi>truth,</hi> but in the <hi>light of inward evidence</hi> and <hi>experience,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in ſuch a manner of <hi>Balaam, to ſee him but not near;</hi> but not in the <hi>knowledge of converſe,</hi> and <hi>fellowship</hi> with that <hi>God,</hi> whom they profeſſe to know, or what it is to have their ſoul <hi>inward,</hi> and <hi>familiar</hi> with him, in the experience of ſuch a thing. 10. It is by inward <hi>experience</hi> upon the ſouls of men, that God doeth in a more ſpecial way <hi>ſecure,</hi> and preſerve, that <hi>ſacred record of his truth</hi> in the World, then by <hi>humane Lawes,</hi> or authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; by ane <hi>internal</hi> conforming of the ſpirits of his people, to his revealed truth, whereby the inward man becomes as a <hi>repoſitory</hi> thereof, for when men once become Chriſtians in truth, they are then the <hi>declared Epiſtle of Christ</hi> by ane indiſſoluble union of the truth, and their ſouls together. I ſhall but add, that the <hi>experimental part of Religion</hi> is not perfited here, but within a little, there will be ane entrance on ane eternity of <hi>experience</hi> of what once with admiration, and deſire, was hoped for, and the enjoiment of that ſtate above will be no <hi>object of Faith,</hi> but of <hi>ſenſe</hi> and purely <hi>experimental.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Second Intent of this Inquiry,</hi> should be to clear, how the enjoiment of one Chriſtian in the way of <hi>experience,</hi> may be no <hi>meaſure,</hi> or <hi>rule to others in the tryall of their ſtate,</hi> upon theſe <hi>grounds.</hi> 1. That the leaſt reall evidence of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:31860:22"/> 
               <hi>Sanctifying vertue of the truth,</hi> bears witneſs to the truth of a <hi>new life,</hi> and of <hi>ſpiritual ſenſe,</hi> and diſcerning herewith, as a <hi>few grapes</hi> does diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a <hi>vine,</hi> and a <hi>bramble.</hi> 2. Becauſe the reall Work of God, may be long without the <hi>witneſs</hi> thereof, and the firſt giving of the <hi>new life,</hi> and a <hi>diſcerning</hi> of the ſame, are diſtinct acts of the ſpirit, which doe rarely go together, ſo as to know when the <hi>pulſe</hi> of this <hi>life</hi> does begin firſt to beat. 3. As there are different <hi>ſiſes,</hi> and grouth amongſt the Saints within time; ſo does the <hi>talent of experience</hi> and <hi>inward obſervation,</hi> much differ in the ſtate of ſome, in reſpect of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and does anſwer to higher <hi>conflicts</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults in a Chriſtians warefare, and higher im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of grace herein; whence it is that <hi>patience brings forth experience,</hi> and as it hath ſo great a <hi>room,</hi> and ſervice for God; bejond o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graces of the ſpirit, ſo hath it a great income of reward; by the moſt rare, and inriching <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> of a Chriſtians life; thence is it that theſe of the <hi>higheſt form of Chriſtians</hi> and of the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt ſpirit, has been put to a higher exerciſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then others, and made to be a more publick bleſſing by example herein to their Generation. 4. It is clear, <hi>the experimental part</hi> of Chriſtianity may have reſpect to ſome ſpecial <hi>times,</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of mens life,</hi> ſo as one day may be more memorable, then as they have ever known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; yea to ſuch times, when they are put to a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:31860:22"/> higher ſervice in the <hi>tryall of their Faith,</hi> and led unto paths of providence, that might ſeem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trodden, which hath been uſually a time of great <hi>obſervation</hi> as to a higher light, and evidence on the <hi>experimental tryall of Religion.</hi> 5. This dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent meaſure hath reſpect alſo, to the <hi>first entry</hi> of Chriſtians on ſome very dark paths of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, when the <hi>Lord is to lead, and encline them into a wilderneſs,</hi> by giving in aſſurance with a <hi>double meaſure</hi> on their ſouls, like <hi>Elijahs call to ariſe, and eat,</hi> and <hi>Joſephs dream twice given,</hi> when his conflicts, and tryalls were to be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled upon him; yea this may be alſo on this ground, as it is peculiar to ſome Chriſtians above others to be kept more cloſs on ſuch a <hi>Scent,</hi> in that rare exerciſe to <hi>diſcern the workings of God on their ſoull,</hi> and to try the certainty hereof from the <hi>natural work of their own Spirit;</hi> and who may be more exact then others, to <hi>lay up,</hi> and <hi>record the ſame,</hi> and not loſe the leaſt fragment of ſuch <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances to their Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>This Inquiry</hi> should be of ſpecial uſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to know <hi>what great things theſe are, to which, the experimental part of Christianity does relate,</hi> wherein they of the <hi>lowest ſiſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have a common, and joint interest</hi> whatever difference be in the <hi>degree;</hi> but it is a very <hi>short touch</hi> I can here give on ſo great a ſubject and on ſome few <hi>Heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The <hi>tranſlation, and entry of a Christian
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:31860:23"/> unto a new ſtate, and world, here in the earth;</hi> is one of the greateſt things of <hi>experience</hi> (tho it hath not a like clear evidence, nor the preciſe time, and <hi>entry</hi> can be in the ſame manner known) for men to know ſo marvelous a <hi>change</hi> in themſelves, and that here is no <hi>illuſion</hi> or <hi>dream,</hi> and how it is ſure this was never told to mankind but in the <hi>Bible,</hi> which none ever did foreſee, or project to themſelf; yea which in the very <hi>notion</hi> thereof, was once a <hi>terra incognita</hi> to them; and could have no poſſible riſe from <hi>nature</hi> whoſe proper work is to <hi>overcome nature.</hi> I know this may ſeeme aſtoniſhing, and not eaſie for many to bear, that profeſſed Chriſtians may have the ſame need to be converted to Chriſtianity that <hi>Pagans</hi> have, or perish, that the letter of the word only, or any length in exter al duties can ſave none, who know nothing of internal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or the ſpiritual Powers of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>2. It does relate to this <hi>Head,</hi> to know that <hi>God and his People here in the World, are no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to other in the truth, and enjoiment of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him,</hi> for as this is ane <hi>eſſential part of our Faith,</hi> and one of the moſt ſure, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished <hi>conſtitutions of our Religion,</hi> by ane <hi>unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable rule,</hi> ſo is it matter of undoubted enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without which a Chriſtians <hi>courſe,</hi> and <hi>paſſage</hi> through time were <hi>unpaſſible;</hi> it is true this is ſo great a thing as may make the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Chriſtian to <hi>be a wonder to himſelf,</hi> and is not a <hi>ſubject</hi> of ordinary thoughts.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:31860:23"/>
            <p>3. To this belongs alſo the <hi>truth;</hi> and <hi>enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſupernatural comforts here on the earth</hi> ſuch as <hi>peace immediatly from God, and the joys of the Holy Ghost,</hi> which can have no poſſible riſe from nature. and was never known to men, but on this <hi>tryall of experience,</hi> that ſuch a thing is ſure, with reſpect unto which the <hi>higheſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of nature</hi> are low, and of mean concern; yea which are comforts of that kind, as can be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known by its contrary, and hath been ſtill more ouweing to the <hi>ſorest conflicts,</hi> then to the <hi>ſweeteſt calm</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtians life,</hi> and ſuch as the elect Angels did never know or partake of.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>prevalency of prayer with God,</hi> and to know with aſſured evidence both the <hi>acceptance hereof in Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>returns thereof upon the earth,</hi> is alſo one of theſe great things of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi> and can never be known elſe as a ſubject of contemplation only, which hath been direct of the Lord as a preſcript for ſuch ones where no humane wiſdome or power could poſſibly anſwer, and is not bounded by the moſt deſperate caſe, which would ſeem to ſhut out all hope and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radgment. But as to this I muſt ſay how little ſeemes that part of our Religion, tho one of the moſt wonderful parts thereof to be improven in that manner now as in former times, and in the moſt extraordinare exigences which Chriſtians have been in, yea how low a trade is it which by moſt this day is carried on, in ſo marvelous a way
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:31860:24"/> as this, which the Lord hath eſtabliſhed betwixt <hi>heaven and earth,</hi> and hath ſuch immediate cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the whole <hi>inward life, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls of Chriſtianity,</hi> to preſerve and ſtrenthen the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A 5. Head</hi> on this Subject to be matter of great thoughts and <hi>reflection</hi> is this, that here on the earth there is ſuch a thing to be enjoyed in the truth and certainty of <hi>experience,</hi> as an <hi>earnest and ſeall of the Spirit of God 2 Corinth 1: 22. who hath alſo ſealed us, and given us the earneſt of the Spirit in our hearts Ephes. 1: 13. in whom alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ye beleeved, ye were ſealed by that Holy Spirit of promiſe, which is the earneſt of our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance &amp;c. 2 Corinth. 5: 5. now he that hath wrought us for the ſelf ſame thing is God, who hath alſo given us the earneſt of his Spirit.</hi> I know there hath been much inquiry on this <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> as to a clear <hi>ſence,</hi> and judgment thereof, both by <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> and <hi>Practical Writers,</hi> tho it is ſuch a thing as muſt needs be a ſtrange, and dark riddle where the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> is not the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter;</hi> and ſome near entercourſe with this great <hi>teacher,</hi> that in his <hi>light we may ſee light;</hi> but that it is ſurely promiſed of God, and could never have entred on mens thoughts, if it were not purely a divine Revelation, none will offer to queſtion; and that the experience of the ſame in all times of the Church, hath no leſs tendency to confirm and ſeall the truth of Chriſtianity,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:31860:24"/> then it hath to confirm a Chriſtians ſtate; but though I doubt not your acquaintance herewith is bejond many, yet this beeing a truth of ſuch high concern, ſo far as I have attained, I would offer ſome light hereon, wherein my ſoul hath found <hi>reſt</hi> and <hi>ſettlement,</hi> as to a clear ſence and concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame. 1. That how rare ſoever the <hi>experience</hi> of this may be this day, yet is it not the peculiar priviledge of ſome <hi>few, ſelect,</hi> and <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Chriſtians,</hi> or what God does rarely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and on ſome ſingular account to his people, but is the ſettled priviledge of all who are <hi>led by the Spirit,</hi> and under his conduct. 2. This is ane <hi>experiment of the Chriſtian Faith,</hi> which no humane teſtimony or <hi>vocal evidence</hi> can expreſs, that which is <hi>inward,</hi> and a ſecret betwixt God and the ſoul, or what <hi>taſte that hidden Manna hath Rev. 2: 17. which none knowes but he that enjoys the ſame;</hi> for this is not the <hi>promiſe,</hi> which is given to be the <hi>object of our Faith,</hi> but is the <hi>ſeall of the Spirit of promiſe,</hi> and the <hi>proper object of ſpiritual ſenſe;</hi> it is an internal work which goes above words, and ſuch as God alone can impart, who only can reveal his own love to the ſoul, and <hi>Shed abroad the ſence hereof,</hi> and hath reſerved this to himſelf; it is that alſo which gives a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct evidence from any moral influence of the word, tho it can never be disjoined, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the ſame, but is ſuch ane internal appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation hereof, as puts their ſouls to reſt and quiet
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:31860:25"/> thereon. 3. It is here muſt be underſtood a more <hi>near</hi> and <hi>ſolemn approach of God,</hi> and ſome <hi>higher enjoiment of Spiritual Senſe,</hi> then is uſually known which will make ſuch a time remarkable, and ſweet to a Chriſtians after remembrance, tho ſome in, a more extraordinar way, and higher degree, may have this imparted then others, as the tryall of their Faith hath been more heightned, and hath attained to higher actings of grace under the ſame, according to that ſettled <hi>Connection Iſay</hi> 57: 12. I doubt not, there may be high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to this <hi>Seall and earneſt,</hi> who know little what in the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>order of grace</hi> is required to prepare, and qualifie for the ſame, but except the <hi>ſetled conſtitutions</hi> of the Ghoſpel, should be changed for their ſake; it is then ſure that God did never <hi>ſeall the comforts of his Spirit,</hi> or his reſpects and approving teſtimony on ſuch, who are of ane untender, unhumbled, and vindictive ſpirit, and is no more poſſible, then as <hi>Job 18: 4. That the earth should be forſaken for them, and the rock removed out of its place.</hi> 4. It is true this is more clearly underſtood by ſuch, who by <hi>reaſon of uſe, have their ſenſes exerciſed both to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern good, and evill Hebrews</hi> 5: 14. and have thus attained a more deep, and judicious refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for the tryall of the ſame, ſince this is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually one of the moſt ſearching exerciſes of a Chriſtian, to diſcern the <hi>voice of the Spirit of God,</hi> and know the ſame, from that of a <hi>Stranger,</hi> and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:31860:25"/> to come to the light herein, to ſee that ſuch a <hi>ſeall,</hi> or any rare enjoiments of that kind, are aſſuredly from God, and wrought in him <hi>John</hi> 3: 21. It is clear alſo how, many <hi>sharp conflicts,</hi> and <hi>a hotter ware fare</hi> allotted to ſome of the Saints, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, under griefs, troubles, and oppoſitions in their Chriſtian courſe, hath made way at ſo dear a rate for their acquaintance with the ſame, ſo as the gradual difference, in the truth of this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, may be ſtrange, and marvelous, and cauſe fear to impart the ſame, nor be ever known within time. 5. Tho it is ſure, that all who are entred in a <hi>reconciled ſtate with God,</hi> muſt be <hi>ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Spirit,</hi> yet is not this to be underſtood as the ordinar <hi>food,</hi> and <hi>dyet of a Chriſtian,</hi> but as ſome more ſpecial <hi>reſtorative,</hi> and <hi>cordial,</hi> ſo as one enjoiment of this kind, hath been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo remarkable, that through the whole courſe of a Chriſtians life after, it hath been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtrenthning to their Faith; yet is it no rare thing to theſe who are keeped in a more near in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy of converſe with God, to whom, the truth of this <hi>ſeall</hi> not once, but in innumerable times, hath been known, who, on the other hand does know alſo, how long, and ſenſible reſtraint of this great enjoiment may be, when the choiſeſt promiſes of the Word, can afford no comfort, but when the <hi>premiſes are clear,</hi> the <hi>concluſion is oft ſuspended</hi> through <hi>hid jealouſies,</hi> and <hi>legall fears of the ſpirit of bondage.</hi> 6. It is ſure this
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:31860:26"/> 
               <hi>bleſſed ſeall</hi> lyes here alſo, in ſome ſpecial <hi>directive work of the Spirit of God,</hi> to make uſe of <hi>light,</hi> in <hi>particular caſes</hi> with <hi>aſſurance,</hi> and <hi>quiet of mind,</hi> and in <hi>ſealing inſtruction</hi> with that evidence, and power on the ſoull, as leaves ſuch a <hi>print</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> thereon as the <hi>ſeall</hi> leaves on the <hi>wax,</hi> this can be no ſtrange, or unknown thing to theſe who in a cloſe adherence, to Scripture light hath been ſpecially tender to try the ſame thereby, and under a juſt horror, and dread of <hi>Enthuſiasm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> or the ſmalleſt dasſhing on ſuch a <hi>rock</hi> 7. But it is ſpecially diſcernable, where this <hi>ſeall</hi> and <hi>earnest</hi> hath been more abundantly let forth to ſome bejond others; that it was for ſome higher ſupport to their Faith, where a <hi>long interval of delay</hi> was to be between the <hi>promiſe,</hi> and <hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and ſuch a tryall of a <hi>deferred hope</hi> herein, as might be ready to make <hi>their heart ſick</hi> into death, if the Lord had not given ſuch a <hi>pledge</hi> and <hi>part in hand</hi> to aſſure them that the reſt shall not faill in due time, now this is ſo manifeſt in the <hi>conduct,</hi> and <hi>methods</hi> of grace, about the Saints under the <hi>old Teſtament,</hi> and in how ſingular a <hi>way</hi> he did firſt <hi>ſeall,</hi> before he entred them upon any <hi>great tryalls,</hi> and which were to be of a <hi>long du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> as there needs no particular <hi>instances</hi> to clear the ſame. 8. It is here; the ſence of that <hi>hundred fold,</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> hath ſo expreſly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to his People on the adventures of their Faith may be underſtood, as that which aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:31860:26"/> lyes in theſe rare enjoiments of the ſpirit, and <hi>inward ſenſe of the love of their God,</hi> in the shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his face on them, which are the <hi>first fruits of the Spirit;</hi> more then in any external provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or theſe things which are of the higheſt value with men; ſince as this is the moſt ſure and greateſt evidence that we are Chriſtians, ſo is it the moſt notable <hi>ſign</hi> how dear ſuch are to God, and of his <hi>love</hi> and <hi>favour,</hi> then if he had given them the whole World. I know nothing will ſeem more ſtrange, and disrelishing to the ſpirit of moſt this day then ſuch a thing, but <hi>wisdom is juſtified of her Children,</hi> and with ſuch let my <hi>ſoul</hi> be joined in. 9. As it is known and ſure that here is no <hi>illuſion</hi> or <hi>imaginary thing,</hi> where any <hi>fallacy</hi> or <hi>deceit</hi> lyes, to the moſt judicious and obſerving Chriſtians, who knows herein, what makes them glad, and whence it is, and how no aſſiſtance of their own ſpirit, or in the power of nature could poſſibly impart ſuch a thing; ſo may it be aſtonishing how ſuch who live under the Profeſſion of Chriſt, and hath any deſign on ane eternal ſtare in Heaven, can take this on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, or be ſo little inquiſitive about ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a truth, that there should be ſuch ane enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here on the earth, which without any <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſe,</hi> can put the ſoul of men into ane <hi>entire rest, and ſettlement,</hi> and when under greateſt <hi>shakings</hi> and <hi>fears</hi> other ways, cauſe them know the truth of <hi>pardon,</hi> and <hi>peace with God</hi> with a ſure
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:31860:27"/> evidence, yea at ſo low ane ebb can immediatly revive and raiſe with ſo diſcernable a change in their inward caſe; for if this be ane undoubted matter of experience it should be not eaſie for men to live without tryall hereof themſelves. 10. Let me <hi>add</hi> further, here is a part of that <hi>communion</hi> which Chriſtians have within time, with the moſt <hi>excellent of the earth;</hi> and ſuch who in all <hi>ages of the Church</hi> have been the greateſt lovers of God, and adventurers for him; ſuch with whom he hath been moſt familiar, and hath admit not only to the <hi>allowance of Subjects,</hi> but the <hi>regard of favourites,</hi> who hath known how great a <hi>Rewarder</hi> he is of his own <hi>grace,</hi> yea ſuch, who have made the moſt exact <hi>inquiry</hi> and <hi>tryall,</hi> upon the truth and ſecurity of their comfort here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and <hi>hath put to their ſeall that God is faithfull and true, in that he hath thus promiſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. There is this <hi>ſpecial uſe</hi> to be made of ſuch ane <hi>enquiry on the truth of inward experience, to ſee how great, and wonderful a Subject we have for reflection hereon;</hi> and of what ſingular advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage this ſhould be for ſtrenthning the ſoul of a Chriſtian, againſt the workings of <hi>unbeleef,</hi> and to give a more full ſecurity of mind in the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of hope and relyance upon God, for things to come. It is ſure the <hi>reflex faculty of man</hi> is one of the greateſt <hi>wonders of nature,</hi> and if the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>uſe,</hi> and improvement hereof were more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood on this <hi>Subject,</hi> and what it is to dive in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:31860:27"/> to theſe ſtill and deep waters, it might make ſuch be oft as a <hi>wonder</hi> to themſelves. I shall but point at a few <hi>reflex acts</hi> of a Chriſtian on this great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of ſpiritual experience, to shew what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>enjoiments,</hi> theſe are admit to herein, which the whole reſidue of mankind knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of 1. To have ſuch great ſupernatural truths of the Scripture, which did once exceed their faith, and reaſon, to be now matter of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted <hi>experience</hi> in the truth, power, and efficacy hereof on their own ſouls; and thus to know what belongs to the enjoiments of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſence, which formerly ſeemed ſo darke and incomprehenſible a thing, yea how great a <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> there is betwixt the <hi>cleareſt Acts of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>underſtanding</hi> about <hi>divine things;</hi> and a reall <hi>fealing</hi> of the ſame in the <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> thereof; betwixt the moſt ſublime apprehenſions by <hi>theory;</hi> and the <hi>ſenſible impreſſions,</hi> by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and what a preſent, and marvelous change this makes on the ſoull of a Chriſtian. 2. To enjoy the ſame no leſs under a full <hi>evidence,</hi> and <hi>certainty</hi> of the truth thereof as <hi>the alone,</hi> and <hi>immediate Work of God,</hi> then in their felt power and ſweetneſſe; &amp; that here was no <hi>caſual thing,</hi> or matter of doubtfulneſs or uncertainty, but where they can clearly ſee the <hi>object</hi> of their <hi>faith</hi> on the <hi>truth of divine Revelation,</hi> now to be the <hi>object</hi> of there <hi>inward Sence,</hi> and <hi>enjoyment;</hi> and are ſure that what <hi>God hath ſpoken,</hi> he <hi>hath done
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:31860:28"/> according to the ſame;</hi> for if this be not clear; <hi>Spiritual comforts</hi> would be of low value if it were not with that evidence, and aſſurance of being <hi>Gods ſeall,</hi> as they could adventure their eternal ſtate on the truth hereof. 3. And how ſweet a part is it, when they can thus reflect on their <hi>own</hi> experience, and enjoy the ſame with no leſs evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the <hi>proper cause,</hi> and <hi>original,</hi> then of the truth of its <hi>effects,</hi> which is one of the greateſt helps to give ſtability, and aſſurance to our Faith; to ſee how the <hi>power of Religion</hi> is never barren of <hi>new experiments</hi> of the truth hereof, how the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <hi>objective means</hi> in the way of light cannot doe, if there were not an <hi>Internal effective cauſe,</hi> that works powerfully herein, and as in <hi>nature,</hi> ſo in the <hi>way of grace,</hi> how the <hi>ſame cauſe,</hi> which <hi>makes us live, must make us move,</hi> and <hi>act,</hi> yea to ſee how the ſame ſpirit that confirms a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> on the truth of his <hi>ſtate,</hi> and of the <hi>enjoiments of grace</hi> here, does confirm <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and the <hi>enjoyments of glory,</hi> which muſt infallibly follow the ſame, and ere long be a matter of their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience alſo. 4. To know this way, that ſurely a <hi>nearer intimacy</hi> is to be enjoyed with <hi>God,</hi> and of a <hi>higher kind,</hi> which is by the <hi>communion of the Holy Ghost,</hi> then by the <hi>immediate miniſtry of the Angels,</hi> yea a <hi>greater evidence</hi> thus given to a Chriſtians ſoul, then by any external <hi>miracles;</hi> ſince this is a <hi>ſeall</hi> of that nature, as is given to none, but ſuch as are the <hi>objects of the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:31860:28"/> and <hi>delight;</hi> and its ſure the alone grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt evidence of divine love lyes in the <hi>internal part of Chriſtianity,</hi> and theſe immediate opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit of God, more then by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal providences. 5. To ſee, how theſe great things of <hi>experience,</hi> come under a <hi>preſent tryall,</hi> and given to be experienced here on the <hi>earth,</hi> and are not ſome <hi>rare contingency,</hi> or what may be ſtated on an <hi>extraordinar</hi> account, but does keep cloſs with a <hi>tender walk,</hi> and near enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours with God through a Chriſtians whole courſe; and thus knows what ſuch an <hi>anointing with fresh oyl</hi> means <hi>Pſalm</hi> 92: 10. by innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reiterated times of ſuch enjoiment; yea how the ſenſe and ſweetneſs thereof comes not then by the <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>workings of reaſon;</hi> but the <hi>immediatneſs of the divine preſence,</hi> tho even then it does not exclude ſuch a <hi>discurſive work,</hi> in the clearneſs of <hi>Spiritual reaſon,</hi> and <hi>light,</hi> as can fully quiet the mind, that here is no <hi>illuſion,</hi> or <hi>deceit;</hi> but lets us ſee, that the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> can make uſe of an <hi>argument</hi> to ſettle, and ſecure the ſoul when all eſſays, whither from themſelves, or others can give no releaf. 6. Thus are they admitt to ſee herewith, how deep the foundation of our <hi>comfort,</hi> and <hi>ſecurity,</hi> is layd on <hi>the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God</hi> in <hi>his</hi> revealed truth, ſo as the whole <hi>frame of Chriſtianity</hi> muſt be diſſolved, and fall ere one ſpecial act of truſt, and adventure on his hand, and under the aſſured warrant of his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:31860:29"/> truth, ſhould be fruſtrate; and that the <hi>ſafe conduct</hi> alſo, and <hi>ſecurity of one Chriſtian,</hi> in his paſſage through time, is of that <hi>conſequence,</hi> and ſo <hi>eſſential a part of the great frame of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> that this should not be entire, and perfect if it should fail, as to the meaneſt of the Saints, to make ſo great a <hi>nullity</hi> herein. 7. And is it not, in ſuch a <hi>reflex work</hi> on the truth of <hi>experience,</hi> that ſuch can only know the <hi>ſweet enjoiments of times past,</hi> and what that peculiar comfort <hi>of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi> means; which I muſt reckon one of the rareſt, and moſt unknown enjoiments this day under the Sun; ſince it is ſure, this can never be from the <hi>greatest delights of the earth,</hi> when once paſſed, which as they return no more, ſo does ever leav a bitter <hi>ſting,</hi> and <hi>remembrance,</hi> by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive reſult of the ſame; whilſt that which hath been experienced in the way of God, can neither <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,</hi> nor loſe its <hi>ſweetneſs,</hi> but will render the moſt <hi>afflicting part of their life past,</hi> which was moſt bitter, and ſore then, to be the moſt <hi>comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting part</hi> thereof to their remembrance, when they can ſee herein both what they have <hi>deſigned for God,</hi> and he hath <hi>done for them.</hi> 8. If there be any comfort <hi>of love, in the Communion of the Saints here</hi> within time, they may ſee how this is not attainable, but in the <hi>light of inward expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> whence they know, what it is to meet, and have fellowship in the ſame <hi>Savour,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish of the things of God,</hi> when in a ſpiritual frame,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:31860:29"/> and to be <hi>mutually discloſed</hi> as they can diſcern ſomething of the excellency of one <hi>anothers ſpirit,</hi> and of the power, and lively workings of <hi>inward grace,</hi> by that <hi>native luſtre, and evidence,</hi> which thus followes the ſame; ſo as under the ſenſible power of ſuch <hi>attractions</hi> their ſouls are more clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely unite, and joined together, yea are mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſtrenthned by other conflicts, and what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments they have made of divine truth herein as to their releaf. And I muſt ſay where this is not underſtood, that great <hi>mystery of the Communion of the Saints,</hi> is but a <hi>ſtrange</hi> and <hi>dark notion;</hi> nor without this can that ſpecial deſign of the Lord in the <hi>ſettlement of Churches in a viſible ſtate,</hi> be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther known or anſwered, which is to have exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ordinances carried on with life, and power amongſt men, and enjoying communion with our <hi>bleſſed head</hi> herein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> VII. <hi>and laſt</hi> INQUIRY. I would make as to a more full aſſurance of underſtanding on the truth of our profeſſion, and for further clearing of this <hi>great Subject</hi> of the <hi>experimental part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> is to know the <hi>quality of the witneſſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> which is an <hi>Inquiry</hi> of a higher concern and import then ſeems to be apprehended, or of what weight, and neceſſity this is, upon theſe <hi>grounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Becauſe the whole truth of <hi>Spiritual expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> is matter of <hi>fact,</hi> and founded on a <hi>certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſenſe,</hi> it is <hi>truth in the event and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:31860:30"/> and not what <hi>God does ſpeak,</hi> but what <hi>according to the ſame he hath done;</hi> ſo that this is not upon any <hi>principle of Faith,</hi> but on mens <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal tryall of the ſame,</hi> according to that <hi>Iſai. 43: v. 10. ye are my witneſs ſays the Lord, that ye may know, and beleeve me, and underſtand that I am he;</hi> for tho it is of divine, and infallible truth, that whatever God hath <hi>aſſured by promiſe</hi> he will do; yet the experience hereof, ſince the <hi>Canon of the Scripture was ſealed,</hi> is of humane record, and a <hi>teſtimony</hi> which could bear no weight from the greateſt of men, if the <hi>quality of ſuch witneſſes</hi> were not <hi>tried,</hi> and conſidered herein. 2. Becauſe the higheſt pretence to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual enjoiments in the way of the <hi>promiſe</hi> is but a falſe teſtimony, where there is no tender regard herewith to the <hi>precepts of the Ghoſpel,</hi> when this connection is indiſſoluble <hi>Act 9. they walked in the fear of God, and comforts of the Holy Ghost; doe not my words good to them that walk uprightly Mica</hi> 2: 7. It is true, that choiſeſt Chriſtians may be much hid, and in the dark herein to others, and upon ſuch an account ſhould have a ſad part, if they were tryed, and judged by men; only this is ſure, there can be no more in the <hi>concluſion</hi> then is in the <hi>premiſes,</hi> and that a Chriſtians <hi>teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> to the truth lyes more in <hi>what they are,</hi> then <hi>what they expreſs to others.</hi> 3. The <hi>quality</hi> of the <hi>witneſſes</hi> is of ſuch weight here, and to be ſpecially regarded, as one of the <hi>highest ſervices
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:31860:30"/> for God within time</hi> under their hand, to <hi>put too their ſeall,</hi> and <hi>teſtimony that God is true in what he hath promiſed;</hi> who are as it were <hi>judicially ſiſted</hi> in behalf of his <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>faithfulnes;</hi> ſince his <hi>declarative glory before angels,</hi> and <hi>men,</hi> does more peculiarly ly here then in the whole <hi>Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi> and <hi>frame of this Creation.</hi> This is a <hi>trust</hi> and <hi>debt</hi> alſo upon each <hi>age</hi> of the Church, that the <hi>truth and faithfulnes of their God may be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt to the generations to come</hi> with ſuch a <hi>confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory ſeall.</hi> 4. This <hi>Inquiry</hi> is the more called for, to know what theſe are who bear ſuch a <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> to the truth, upon the <hi>exceeding greatnes of theſe things</hi> which belong to Chriſtian <hi>experience,</hi> ſince this might awake the moſt ſublime, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive ſpirits of the time to ſearch herein, and be a Subject of <hi>great thoughts</hi> and <hi>reflection,</hi> that ſuch are on the earth, yea an <hi>innumerable part of men,</hi> who do verily enjoy ſo <hi>marvelous a light</hi> as is <hi>immediatly out of Heaven,</hi> and shines upon none elſe; and knowes ſuch an enjoiment, as an <hi>immediate communion</hi> with the <hi>Deity,</hi> and his <hi>ſenſible preſence with their Spirits,</hi> with <hi>returns from Heaven to their ſuits</hi> in moſt <hi>reall effects;</hi> ſince if this be ſure, then muſt men ſeek for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>Idea of Chriſtianity,</hi> &amp; have other thoughts about the ſame, then what moſt ſeem to have, then is there a higher glory put upon mens ſouls in the way of grace, and their beeing <hi>partakers of the divine nature,</hi> then what all humane gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:31860:31"/> can ever amount to, or is upon the Sun, and the Stars of Heaven. 5. The <hi>credit, and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Witneſſes</hi> on this <hi>great head of Spiritual experience,</hi> and the whole <hi>internal part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity</hi> is of ſuch weight that the ſpirit of this age, and moſt predominant part of men within the Church is ſtated in ſo viſible an oppoſition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, not only to oppoſe the <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>ſpirituality</hi> of Religion, but to deny its <hi>principles,</hi> and give a lye to this teſtimony, of the moſt eminent wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of the ſpirit of God on mens ſouls, as if it were ſome <hi>illuſion</hi> or <hi>impoſture;</hi> which is in effect to take of the <hi>greateſt ſeall</hi> that God hath given to the <hi>Divinity of the Scripture</hi> in the whole <hi>internal demonſtrations</hi> of its truth: this is the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy of this age bejond any times paſt, and may be feared if our Faith ſtood not ſure otherways, that the light ſhould be quickly extinguiſhed, and the candleſtick taken away from moſt of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches; when moſt, under ſuch a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion yet never knew, the <hi>power, vertue,</hi> and <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the truth</hi> they profeſs on their own ſoul, and that there is another evidence or teaching, then by <hi>moral ſwaſion</hi> only, or another key to open the heart, then <hi>external means;</hi> and thus muſt either oppoſe themſelves to ſo tormenting a light, or be unavoidably condemned hereby.</p>
            <p>But with this <hi>Inquiry</hi> as to the credit and <hi>quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the witneſſes,</hi> who in all ages of the Church bears the ſame teſtimony to the truth from their
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:31860:31"/> 
               <hi>experience,</hi> it is undenyable alſo, but that there are ſome in a <hi>more ſingular way ſiſted, and under more peculiar engagements then others</hi> to appear on ſuch a <hi>teſtimony,</hi> and who may be admit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiments of <hi>experience,</hi> that are out of the <hi>ordinary road</hi> of Gods dealing with his people, tho this muſt in no other ſenſe be underſtood <hi>extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> then from ſo <hi>judicial a time</hi> as this, and the great <hi>decay of the Power of Chriſtianity</hi> with this generation why theſe are ſo rare, and not in beeing any way croſs to the <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>ſettled conſtitutions of the Ghoſpel,</hi> or without that <hi>precinct of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God to warr and the ſame;</hi> and I hope the Church of Chriſt is yet to enter on ſuch enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of experience that would not be eaſie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in this day we are in, were they told us at a diſtance. But what I mean hereby of theſe, who may be in a higher capacity then others for ſuch a <hi>witneſs</hi> I shall breefly touch.</p>
            <p>1. Theſe who through grace hath been admit to <hi>ſome higher intimacy of converſe with God, and to know his dealing familiarly with men here on the earth,</hi> then may be ever known in ſuch a degree to other choiſe, and reall Chriſtians; tho I judge this may be more rarely known, that where it is moſt in truth, there alſo is a humble conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and beeing hid in the ſame, their uſual ſtudie, who finds more ſweetneſs in ſuch enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the leſs air they take; &amp; I have oft thought ſuch may be leaſt known on the earth in this day
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:31860:32"/> who may be the greateſt <hi>favourits of Heaven,</hi> and have had moſt rare, and immediate <hi>teſtimonies</hi> of the love, and reſpects of their God; but as this is not the <hi>standard</hi> by which the truth, and reality of grace is to be judged; ſo should this <hi>witneſs</hi> be to me no further ſtrenthning, then it hath ſome greater height in <hi>humility,</hi> and <hi>tenderneſs of Spirit</hi> in the ways of God going alongſt herewith, and ſome more ſingular eminency of grace as does an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to that <hi>Iſai 57: 15. John</hi> 14: 21.</p>
            <p>2. I muſt judge theſe alſo have <hi>a higher room</hi> in this <hi>witneſs for God on their experience of his truth,</hi> who have in a <hi>more ſingular way then others known the truth of ſupernatural aſſistance, and ſuſtaining grace under extraordinar tryalls.</hi> I mean ſuch Chriſtians as have been tryed not only in the <hi>truth,</hi> but in the <hi>ſtrenth of divine grace,</hi> at another rate then others, whom I muſt reckon amongſt the greateſt <hi>witneſſes</hi> for God in this day, when 1. This renders their <hi>teſtimony</hi> to be of a higher valew and evidence according to the height, and meaſure of their <hi>conflicts,</hi> and <hi>tryalls,</hi> whom thus the Lord hath choiſed, and ſeparate as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was from the <hi>reſidue of his brethren,</hi> for ſuch a ſervice of <hi>example,</hi> that the excellency of his grace might here more brightly ſhine forth. 2. Becauſe the <hi>depoſition</hi> herein, is in a matter on which moſt doe ſtumble at the ways of God, upon that ſcandall of the croſs; and on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it may be ſaid; they are ſent as <hi>meſſengers,</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:31860:32"/> and <hi>ſpyes,</hi> to witneſs what manner of allowance he does then impart, to bear the expence of a more extraordinare time of affliction, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and what immediate ſupport is then found above the allowance of ordinary times; that with <hi>Caleb,</hi> and <hi>Joshua,</hi> they might bear a honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable report for God unto others. 3. The cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of this <hi>testimony</hi> riſeth the higher, as it hath coſt them ſo dear, who bear the ſame, and hath not been eaſily attained, nor is an <hi>offering unto God of that which coſts them nothing,</hi> who have been helped bejond others to glorify him in the <hi>fires.</hi> 4. They are ſuch above the reſidue of Chriſtians, who hath uſually a <hi>record of more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial confirmations,</hi> and great remarks of the way of God, in the <hi>Journal,</hi> and <hi>History of their life;</hi> I know moſt would fear to have a room in ſuch a teſtimony, but as I doubt not there are many ſuch <hi>witneſſes</hi> this day in the earth, ſo I muſt reckon it, one of the moſt honourable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices for God upon it, and will ere long know the full ſence of that truth; when <hi>he hath tryed them to bring them forth as gold Job</hi> 23: 10.</p>
            <p>3. And are not ſuch ſpecially ſiſted as <hi>witneſſes</hi> herein, and under more <hi>ſingular engagements then others,</hi> who upon greater <hi>Services</hi> for God aſſigned to them, hath alſo had more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare allowances, of immediate <hi>divine aſſistance</hi> for the ſame, to witneſs that they have not been ſent hereon on their own <hi>charge,</hi> and <hi>expence;</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:31860:33"/> this is one of the great diſcoveries that the Lord gives unto men of his beeing God, and is a clear, and demonſtrative evidence of that reall, and near communication, which the <hi>Churches head</hi> hath with his <hi>body</hi> here on the earth. I know this hath a ſpecial reſpect to ſuch, as are called of the Lord on that <hi>Service of the Ministry of his Word,</hi> who hath ſome peculiar, and diſtinct part allotted to them as <hi>witneſſes,</hi> and put on a more publick <hi>theater</hi> before the World, to witneſs that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute dependance, which the work, and ſervice of that <hi>ſtation</hi> hath on their <hi>great Master,</hi> and the <hi>outlettings of his Spirit</hi> both for <hi>ſupport,</hi> and <hi>ſucceſs,</hi> and what thus is found in the way of an immediate relyance on him; for I muſt judge that none knowes a near entercourſe with God, and to be <hi>purely acted</hi> for him, on this great <hi>ſervice,</hi> but hath ſome peculiar advantage bejond any elſe for more <hi>fingular,</hi> and <hi>rare confirmations of the truth on their own ſoul,</hi> and of a known, and ſenſible <hi>ſeall</hi> from God both in <hi>fruit,</hi> and <hi>accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of their work;</hi> and tho ſuch who look at a diſtance, cannot diſcern, what may be <hi>betwixt God, and his Servants, in ſome publick admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of his ſervice,</hi> as may be then evident to their ſoul, yet is it oft made ſo far diſcernible, as to ſerve an awful ſence and impreſſion on mens ſpirits, of God in the <hi>Aſſemblies of his Church,</hi> and of the truth of <hi>ſupernatural aſſiſtances,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then <hi>humane</hi> herein; nor does ſuch a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:31860:33"/> 
               <hi>witneſs</hi> ever ceaſe, tho it be now more rare then in times paſt, in this <hi>ſad</hi> and <hi>judicial period of time,</hi> we are fallen in, when almoſt all <hi>ſence, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> and <hi>diſcerning of the Spirit of God,</hi> with <hi>publick adminiſtrations of the Word,</hi> ſeems loſt, &amp; the <hi>wiſdom of Words,</hi> or what may appear more <hi>neat</hi> or <hi>polished</hi> that way, is come in the room hereof, as though the alone end, of ſo high a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice were to <hi>act a ſcene handſomly on a theater</hi> that may carry the applauſe of the <hi>Spectators,</hi> but not <hi>mens hearts unto God;</hi> this I have lookt on with no leſs horror then on the moſt viſible <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and profanity of theſe times, and one of the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal <hi>Signs</hi> in the <hi>publick ſtate of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Theſe alſo may have ſome higher acceſs for ſuch a <hi>witneſs,</hi> who know with evidence, the truth of <hi>immediate, and ſupernatural excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> to engadge upon ſome <hi>ſpecial work,</hi> and <hi>ſervice for God,</hi> and to be acted forth herein un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>irreſiſtable discovery of ane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward call,</hi> when under greateſt oppoſitions from their own ſpirit thereto, and furtheſt a verſion of mind. This I have known in the truth hereof in moſt eminent <hi>examples,</hi> but the credit of ſuch a teſtimony, tho in it ſelf, founded on divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, does neceſſarly require ſuch ane evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the <hi>quality of the witneſſes</hi> herein; that they be of a <hi>known tender, humble,</hi> and <hi>judicious Spirit,</hi> who are <hi>skilled</hi> both in the <hi>deep things of God,</hi> and in the <hi>deeps of Satan,</hi> who this way
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:31860:34"/> does oft act in the greateſt deep, and myſtery of <hi>deluſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. There is yet ſomething more <hi>ſingular</hi> in the <hi>experience</hi> of ſome Chriſtians bejond others, and in ſuch a <hi>witneſs,</hi> as to a <hi>ſpecial confidence,</hi> and <hi>aſſurance raiſed on their ſoul, of events of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and the <hi>iſſue of ſome remarkable caſe of tryall, when it hath been contrare to all humane appearances, and no reaſon from any viſible airth could be given for the ſame;</hi> this I know may ſeem a ſtrange thing in the eyes of many, nor can it poſſibly have that <hi>evidence,</hi> or in that manner work to others, as it is to theſe, who know, and have experienced the ſame, but we ſee, and are ſure there hath been great attainments of ſuch a Faith, both in <hi>Scripture examples,</hi> and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted <hi>experiments,</hi> made hereof in after times, which hath met ſuch in the road of their duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in ane expreſs harmony, and correſpondence with the Word, ſince the <hi>extent of our Faith in any particular caſe,</hi> muſt keep with the ſame <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and meaſure of divine Revelation</hi> herein, and the Lord will be <hi>trusted for no more then he hath made warrantable by his promiſe.</hi> But this is a <hi>Subject,</hi> on which I may not inſiſt further then to clear the <hi>evidence</hi> and truth of the ſame on theſe grounds. 1. That Chriſtians may be at ſuch <hi>ſteps</hi> in their way and paſſage through time, and on ſo dark ground; yea the <hi>tide</hi> of <hi>difficulties,</hi> and <hi>amaſing fears</hi> ſwelled to ſo great a hight, that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:31860:34"/> if there were not a ſupport of this kind, by ane <hi>argument of power,</hi> to their ſoul, they ſhould otherways be ready to ſink. 2. This <hi>experiment</hi> how rare ſo ever it may ſeem to many, is no <hi>dark,</hi> or <hi>diſtinct thing</hi> from that <hi>ſeall of the ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> which we ſhould look after; or from that <hi>promiſed earnest,</hi> which ſometimes the Lord gives, with reſpect to a <hi>ſpecial mercy,</hi> and <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi> within time as well as their <hi>great interest in Heaven,</hi> tho it be not in the ſame <hi>degree</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to ſome as to others. 3. It is alſo of no other kind then that ſettled allowance on the <hi>Saints,</hi> of the <hi>peace of God</hi> in ſuch a meaſure as can raiſe, and fully quiet their ſpirit, above any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king fears, and above the <hi>preſent aſſault</hi> they may be under, tho with ſuch evidence then, as is not poſſible to attain at other times, nor can be kept clear, and comforting to themſelves without much <hi>tenderneſſe of ſpirit and fear.</hi> 4. Where this is known, and enjoyed in any higher degree by ſome then may be the allowance of others, it is aſſuredly found on a ſpecial &amp; near intimacy with God, and to follow ſome diſcernable acceſs, and ſpecial <hi>gale of the ſpirit of interceſſion in prayer, and wreſtlings;</hi> ſo as it thus meets them in the way of a ſettled <hi>ordinance,</hi> and in the ſame way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we may ſee the Saints in Scripture have attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a confidence of this kind; for otherways there could be no comforting evidence of its beeing the undoubted <hi>work of God.</hi> 5. And here
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:31860:35"/> muſt be tryed, &amp; ſought for, whither the more <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate testimony of God,</hi> does then ſtill bring the <hi>testimony</hi> of the <hi>renowed conſcience</hi> alongſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h ſo as to clear the condition in themſelves, and their claim thereto, of ſuch a ſpecial promiſe, whereon their confidence hath been raiſed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is thus rendred to them an <hi>abſolute promiſe,</hi> that can not poſſibly be fruſtrate. 6. I shall but add further as this <hi>rare experiment</hi> comes with ſuch <hi>evidence of ſpiritual ſenſe,</hi> as is diſcernable from any <hi>natural workings</hi> of mans own heart, and is that wherein the moſt deep enquiry and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious tryall of Chriſtians is needful to know that its ſurely from God, and hath both his <hi>warrant,</hi> and <hi>ſeall</hi> herewith, ſo is it not ſtrange that where he takes a more <hi>ſingular way</hi> to <hi>try</hi> and exerciſe ſome, and out of the ordinar road of his dealing with others, yea where ſupport in the way of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal providence</hi> may then ceaſe, that this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial allowance by <hi>inward evidence</hi> be ſomething more ſingular alſo, and ſome <hi>higher influence of the ſpirit and power of beleeving</hi> be imparted for ſuch a <hi>caſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This leads me to offer ſome thoughts in the <hi>cloſe</hi> upon two <hi>Propoſals,</hi> which I did not intend, if from another <hi>airth,</hi> whilſt I was writing this there had not occurred a <hi>ſpecial call</hi> herein, and that I judged it might not be unſuitable to the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of this diſcourſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Whither there be any ſuch <hi>ſeall</hi> to the <hi>truth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:31860:35"/> of Christianity</hi> in theſe times we are now in as the <hi>Faith of Miracles, or that it be warrantable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſuch a thing from God, which lyes in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar act of trust in ſome ſpecial caſe, where a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may be taken off all ordinare means, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a divine immediate, and miraculous Power can anſwer thereto;</hi> for <hi>Anſwer</hi> it is clear the <hi>active Faith</hi> hereof which was once given to <hi>the Primitive Church</hi> in the <hi>workings of miracles</hi> now ceaſeth, but in this <hi>paſſive Sence,</hi> I know no <hi>time,</hi> nor <hi>age,</hi> to which it does not belong, and comes not under the <hi>Promiſe of God,</hi> to warrant the ſame in theſe caſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When the Lord meaſures out <hi>ſuch tryalls</hi> to any of his people in the way of their duty, and under his ſpecial conduct, where there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaf, or ſupport, but in the <hi>Faith of ane extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinar, and immediate appearance of God,</hi> and no neglect in the leaſt; of what in the way of <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinare,</hi> and <hi>warrantable</hi> means is attainable, it is ſure, there it is both warranted and requires ſuch <hi>a Faith,</hi> yea are put by a more ſingular call on the tryall of the ſame, and in this reſpect; I doubt not there hath been, and may yet be in the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age greater attainments of the ſame,</hi> then moſt of Chriſtians can eaſily comprehend, whole tryalls were never brought to ſuch a pitch, and in that manner aſſigned to them; ſince theſe are of the Lord meaſured out only according to the <hi>meaſure of Faith</hi> given them <hi>Rom.</hi> 12: 3.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:31860:36"/>2. As none may <hi>abridge the Spirit of God in the freedome, and Soveraingty of his work</hi> herein, whatever times men be in, ſo is it known and clear, that where the Lord does allott more <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinare caſes</hi> whither to <hi>Churches</hi> or <hi>particular Chriſtians,</hi> when ſuch are keeping cloſe by him, and the revealed rule of their duty, there alſo is a more <hi>extraordinare allowance</hi> for the ſame, yea ſuch a <hi>meaſure and encreaſe of their Faith</hi> to be ſought from the great author thereof, as may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the preſent caſe, to have their <hi>ſtrength</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their <hi>day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It is unqueſtionable that the Lord deſigns in all <hi>ages of his Church,</hi> to bring glory to himſelf, by ſuch a <hi>faith as hath no ground to grip on,</hi> but <hi>ane infinit and immediate power</hi> that can extend it ſelf to the moſt deſperate and amaſing caſe, nor is a <hi>beleeving in hope, when it is to be furthest againſt hope,</hi> a ſtrange and dark thing in this day, either as to the warrant hereof, or theſe proofs, which have been made of the ſame in the iſſue. And herein I muſt judge the appearance of God no leſs wonderful to ſome of his people in that which he <hi>works in them,</hi> and in that deliverance from their <hi>fears</hi> where no <hi>humane Reaſon or Secondary cauſes</hi> could concurr, then in that which he hath <hi>done for them</hi> in the moſt <hi>ſtupendious acts of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> nor does any time want ſome ſhare and proper <hi>talent</hi> of this kinde, if ſuch <hi>great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of God</hi> were more obſerved, that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:31860:36"/> might be ſingularly ſtrenthning to the <hi>Chriſtian Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Is there a reall Chriſtian this day, who is not called to ſuch a <hi>Faith,</hi> that he ſhall once up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf <hi>experience</hi> a greater <hi>miracle</hi> by a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine omnipotent Power</hi> then was yet ever wrought in the earth, which is of the <hi>Reſurrection of his body,</hi> after it hath been for ſome ages diſſolved into duſt, wherein it is, by the undoubted <hi>Faith of miracles</hi> to be wrought upon himſelf, that his greateſt <hi>ſupport</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> within time ſtands; yea if there be ſuch a Faith in the earth, which is now ſtill warranted, as that we have <hi>Pſ.</hi> 46: 12. it muſt then ly in ane <hi>actual trust,</hi> and <hi>relyance in a caſe where a miracle can only help.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. If <hi>poſſeſſions by the Devil</hi> were in that manner now uſual as in the <hi>primitive times,</hi> it is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable, that the <hi>Prayer of Faith</hi> herein for <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion</hi> were not only warranted, but expreſly called for, tho the <hi>inward aſſurance</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Faith</hi> may not in the ſame manner be given to ſome as to others; yet here is a ſpecial ſuiting from God the <hi>proof of a miracle,</hi> by <hi>his immediate Power,</hi> which they are in faith called too; and as that <hi>Preſcript</hi> given by our <hi>Lord of faſting and prayer</hi> for this end does ſtill ſtand in force ſo hath there been known publick inſtances in theſe <hi>late times, of reall diſpoſſeſſions by prayer,</hi> and ſolemn addreſſes to Heaven herein.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If the <hi>oppreſſed innocence of a Chriſtian,</hi> and in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:31860:37"/> ſuch a caſe where the honor of God were highly concerned, ſhould be ſo ſtated, as to be bejond <hi>humane releaf</hi> for clearing the ſame, there might be herein an unqueſtionable reference to God, for his more <hi>immediate deciſion,</hi> and a warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ground to ſuit for the <hi>ſpirit of faith in ſuch a meaſure,</hi> as ſo extraordinare a tryall requires, bejond what in an ordinare caſe is allowable, but ſo as to wait for the ſame, in his ſeaſon and way. This I know was in the <hi>primitive times</hi> in ſome more ſingular manner made uſe off, when no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinare means was attainable for the ſame, but as that could have no ſafe warrant ſo the <hi>Law of jealouſie,</hi> and tryall by the <hi>waters of jealouſie Numb.</hi> 5. was then temporary and is now ceaſed; yet is this ſtill <hi>moral</hi> herein and of <hi>perpetual uſe,</hi> that, God is the ſame who hath reſerved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an immediate appearance of himſelf, when no ordinar means can help; yea that <hi>promiſe Pſ.</hi> 57: 3. is expreſly given for ſuch ane end <hi>of his ſending from Heaven</hi> immediatly to ſave, where no aſſiſtance on the earth is attainable, and all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural means fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I shall but mention here one remarkable <hi>paſſage</hi> of which I am to the furtheſt perſwaded, that may ſeem ſtrange, with reſpect to this late <hi>great Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in the State of Britain;</hi> how it was expreſly <q>foretold under its proper circumſtances many years paſt; and was one of the firſt paſſages of any weight that hath been ſtill fixed in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance; of a relation I had from ane an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and <hi>eminent Miniſter of Christ</hi> of a <hi>Prediction</hi> imparted to him by one of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinar, and Prophetick Spirit in that time; that ſo great, a Scene of Providence should be acted in <hi>Britain,</hi> and change in the publick face of affaires by the coming over of a <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> who should be the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, and Actor therein; and tho ſome particulars relating thereto I cannot exactly remember, yet this in the ſubſtance with ſuch ane expreſs deſignation as I have now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned hath from my young years had a ſettled impreſſion in my memory, and as I am ſure and perſwaded of the truth hereof, and that the foreſaid Relater had ſuch a Prediction long before there was any allyance betwixt the Houſe of <hi>Britain</hi> and of <hi>Orange;</hi> yea am ſure this did exceed the reach of humane apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at that time, from any riſe or tendency of natural cauſes in the order and ſeries thereof; ſo is it not now mentioned after the event only, but what ſeveral years before, I gave ane ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:31860:41"/> and relation off to ſome of great quality, who ſtill know the ſame, when there was not the leaſt appearance of ſuch a thing, tho I could lay no further weight thereon, which ſeemed ſo ſtrange and improbable, but that the thing in it ſelf as to the truth of ſuch a Prediction was reall.</q>
            </p>
            <p>4 That there are <hi>ſupernatural warnings hath been given to men by ſome ſpecial inſtinct and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion not only of the approach of ſome great, and extraordinar tryall</hi> with reſpect to themſelves, but of the near approach of their <hi>death,</hi> yea to ſome, the <hi>preciſe time hereof</hi> is a truth ſo known in the World, and with that undeniable evidence as might fully convince thoſe of the moſt <hi>doubtful, and ſuspicious Spirit</hi> in things of that nature, and were it ſuitable here, I might give ſpecial <hi>inſtances</hi> which I have ſurely known of this kinde with reſpect to ſuch, who were both pious and of great compoſure in their judgment, who hath had ſuch perſwaſion fixed on them without the leaſt preſage from any <hi>natural cauſe,</hi> or what in ane ordinary way could give a riſe thereto, as it did after fall out in the event.</p>
            <p>5. That there are alſo <hi>extraordinare ſigns,</hi> and <hi>forewarnings given the World of great Revolutions and Judgments,</hi> ere they came on particular <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by prodigies and ſignes from Heaven,</hi> is of that <hi>publick evidence,</hi> and certainty as would ſeem not poſſible to queſtion; if ſome methods of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:31860:41"/> to God both in his Word and Works were not peculiar to this age, and the ſpirit thereof this way bejond any that hath gone before, for what may be ſuppoſed and misjudged by many on ſuch ane account through ignorance and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with natural cauſes, and the extent thereof, is not to be queſtioned, but from this, will men debate or diſcredit a truth that all ages muſt witneſs, and theſe of the moſt cautious and diſcerning amongſt men, how ſuch ſolemn <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warnings from Heaven by extraordinar ſigns, and prodigies,</hi> hath been ſtill previous to publick changes and revolutions, and to any great cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and judgements.

            <p>Whilſt I ſpeak on ſuch a Subject; I know there is a ſtrange thing that comes under the <hi>notion,</hi> by many, of a <hi>miracle,</hi> tho matter of very ordinare thoughts with others, and of a light and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon regard about the ſame, which is in that <hi>ſtrange, and aſtonishing cure of the Struma,</hi> or as its termed the <hi>Kings evil by a touch of the hand on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> without any <hi>application of ordinary means;</hi> that here is no <hi>impoſture</hi> in the truth of ſuch a thing, but that many have been undoubtedly healed by this <hi>touch of the Kings of England,</hi> is not queſtionable, which is of ſo <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>impreſs and ſignature</hi> it bears, to difference the ſame from any impoſture, or its beeing a diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſign and work, and ſo this calls for a juſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, and tryall in the preſent <hi>caſe</hi> in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. 1. To know its <hi>true riſe</hi> and <hi>original,</hi> which I find in the <hi>English Chronicles</hi> to be <hi>dated from the time of Edward the Confeſſor,</hi> when <hi>Antichriſtian darkneſs</hi> was then at his greateſt height, it beeing in the 1042 <hi>Year,</hi> when he began to reign, and when that <hi>Prediction of the Apoſtle Theſsal.</hi> 2: 2. of a more then ordinary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and <hi>working of Satan, with ſigns and lying wonders</hi> to promote the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, was then taking place; and was in that ſence only admitt to confirm the <hi>Romish Faith</hi> by ſuch a ſtrange miracle. 2. This <hi>Inquiry</hi> should be neceſſar herein, whither this pretended mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous power belong to the <hi>Crown</hi> only, or hath reſpect to the <hi>Quality, and Holineſs of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> who weare the ſame, ſince if it be to the <hi>first,</hi> then tho ane <hi>Infidel,</hi> or <hi>Mahumetan</hi> were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed on the Throne, if this <hi>gift</hi> follow the ſame it muſt needs be derived to them alſo, and have ſuch a high Priviledge annexed thereto, as the <hi>Throne of Iſrael</hi> never had, when a <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> ſate thereon tho endued with ane ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinare Unction; but if it reſpect the <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Holineſs of the perſons,</hi> it ſurely muſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this no leſs difficult, that not only ſuch as <hi>King Henry the VIII.</hi> and his <hi>Daughter Queen
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:31860:43"/> Mary,</hi> beſides many others, yea <hi>Richard the III.</hi> should on this account have the <hi>active faith of miracles,</hi> and be empoured herewith from God for working of the ſame: beſides this it is known that the <hi>French Kings</hi> claim the ſame pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge and power as peculiar to them alone, and may not on this ground <hi>Lewis the XIV</hi> this day be reckoned a fit inſtrument for ſuch a <hi>healing mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,</hi> and to bring a juſt repute and credit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. 3. But whence is it that ſuch a <hi>hereditary gift</hi> should not faill, and be cutt off by the <hi>departure of England from the Romish Church,</hi> ſince the firſt holding hereof was upon their adherence to the ſame, and as a <hi>confirmatory Seall to the Romish Profeſſion,</hi> or that it should now controll the end for which it was given; I know what ſome <hi>Popish Writers</hi> ſay hereon, that this miracle is not now performed by ſuch who have apoſtatiſed from that faith, <hi>virtute propria, ſed virtute ſigni crucis,</hi> but there needs no ſuch <hi>Salvo,</hi> as to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon its being alienate now from ſerving for the ſame uſe, and end it did before, nor to have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other riſe if it were ſeriouſly pondered. 4. But what intereſt in this cure hath the uſe of ſuch a <hi>rite in applying with the touch a Medal of Gold</hi> to the Patient therewith, or what vertue can this <hi>Amulet</hi> impart, and ſo great a care taken, that they should not loſe it; ſince it is ſure this is not given out of charity to there outward want, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be from oſtentation to shew they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued

If the application of ane <hi>extraordinar gift</hi> for healing diſeaſes without the uſe of <hi>natural means</hi> be aneugh to warrant the ſame, and that ſuch a cure is wrought without any further enquiry as to the cauſe and ground whereon it hath ſuch an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it is then ſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Devil,</hi> and theſe <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of darkneſs</hi> may have a publick and eaſie market in the Chriſtian Church, and exact an uncontrolled homage and ſubjection to them this way. the extent of whoſe power for curing of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, is bejond our reach, but ſince ſuch a <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous gift</hi> of healing if it be of God should be tryed in the truth thereof, how it can anſwer to ſuch peculiar <hi>evidences,</hi> and <hi>criteria</hi> of the ſame, as by the infallible <hi>rule,</hi> and <hi>light of the Scripture</hi> may be clear; it were ſuitable to try herein, if this be indeed given to <hi>confirm and ſeall a divine teſtimony</hi> or any <hi>truth of the written Word;</hi> if it come with that <hi>ſolemne</hi> and <hi>convincing evidence</hi> ſo as to ſerve a <hi>deep</hi> and <hi>reverent ſenſe of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God</hi> on mens ſpirit, by ſuch a diſcovery of himſelf, and to promote <hi>piety,</hi> and more firm adherence to the truth amongſt men, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive effect that should follow a true <hi>miracle,</hi> and ſo extraordinary a ſeall, if it ſerve alſo to comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol the <hi>Kingdom of Satan,</hi> and ſtrenthen the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Antichriſtian
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:31860:44"/> darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry;</hi> yea if theſe who are thus empoured for ſo miraculous a cure have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſuitable on their part of qualifications, to ſuch whom God hath ever made uſe off to work <hi>miracles,</hi> otherwiſe it ſerves only to expoſe ſo great a <hi>ſeall</hi> to the Chriſtian Faith, wherein the <hi>Majeſty of God in ſo august, and ſolemne a way is revealed,</hi> unto the higheſt contumely and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. 6. Though this hath been a continued practice, and that the <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of experience herein in the truth of ſuch a cure is not queſtioned, yet if it be eſſentially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that ſuch as claim to this power, ſhould do it in the <hi>Faith of a divine Warrant,</hi> and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that it is of God, with an immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyance on a ſpecial outſetting of ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar power from him herein, and of his <hi>call</hi> to reſt on the ſame, when it is without reſpect to any <hi>inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,</hi> &amp; <hi>natural means,</hi> yea that there ſpirit in ſuch a caſe ſhould be ſuited to ſo extraordinare a worke, I judge it should then quickly ceaſe; as on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand that theſe who are <hi>deſeaſed,</hi> and apply themſelves to ſuch a <hi>cure,</hi> should know the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of their faith herein, elſe it were as juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable to go to <hi>Loretta</hi> on ſuch an account, or to ſuch who pretend by <hi>ſpells,</hi> and <hi>charms,</hi> to work extraordinary cures without any ordinary means for the ſame. This is not to detract in the leaſt from any juſt right or priviledge of <hi>Soveraing Princes,</hi> and I judge theſe who are now on the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:31860:44"/> 
               <hi>Throne of Britain</hi> might lay as juſt a claim from <hi>perſonal qualifications</hi> thereto, as any have gone before, but in giving to <hi>Caeſar what is due unto him,</hi> we muſt not invade that <hi>Royalty,</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi> which belongs to <hi>God</hi> only, or to pretend to his <hi>ſeall,</hi> and make uſe of it without his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs warrant. If any <hi>Proteſtant Writer</hi> have ſpoke their thoughts on ſuch a <hi>head,</hi> I have as yet ſeen none; bu ſome time paſt, I was neceſſarily <hi>called by a perſon of great worth, to impart my light herein,</hi> they beeing then much perplexed in ſpirit with reſpect to a <hi>near relation</hi> of theirs, in order to their uſing ſuch a mean; and how ſmall a reckoning may be made by many, yet I find it related of that <hi>Famous Chriſtian Mrs Honywood,</hi> that the firſt riſe of theſe terrors of conſcience which keeped her ſo long, was from <hi>conſulting ſome mean as to the recovery of a childe,</hi> in a way that was out of the roade of ordinar means, and made her fear afterwards leſt <hi>Satan</hi> might have <hi>a hand</hi> therein</p>
            <p>But I ſhall now ceaſe to ſpeak more on this <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;</hi> and only ſhut up with ſome <hi>Reflections</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which have been matter of ſerious thoughts to me.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Whence it is that ſuch who are of the most trying and comprehenſive ſpirit hath uſually been under greatest weight and exerciſe of minde, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their eſtablishment in the Chriſtian Faith more then any others:</hi> but herein it may be eaſie to ſee,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:31860:45"/> and diſcern the true <hi>cauſe</hi> thereof, 1. How it is ſure, the more attainment of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>knowledge</hi> is upon the greatneſſe of their <hi>Faith,</hi> that a higher admiration and aſtonishment muſt needs follow thereon; it was this which above all the wonders and depths of nature, did ſwallow up the ſpirit of a <hi>Solomon,</hi> and put him into ſuch an <hi>exſtacy,</hi> when he once begun to fix on this <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but will God indeed dwell, with men on the earth,</hi> yea will the <hi>eternal Son of God</hi> take up his abode, and dwell in ſuch a tabernacle as the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, and become truly man which is ſpecially there imported 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 6: 18. 2. It is theſe only who have their ſouls ſeaſed with a dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe then others, of the <hi>high, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſequence of ſuch a Faith, as to themſelves,</hi> and what is their perſonal intereſt herein; on which their ſouls venture for eternity lyes; ſo as it is not ſtrange, that they can not poſſibly enjoy the comfort of ſuch a Faith under any doubtful ſuſpence this way, or have their ſouls at reſt, with that manner of <hi>aſsent</hi> wherewith moſt ſatisfie themſelves in this day. 3. Yea it is theſe alone, who have another <hi>Idea of Religion,</hi> and the <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Chriſtian Faith</hi> ſettled on their ſpirit, then the reſidue of men, who thus ſee what great things are before them, and shortly to come to paſs, and how ſuch a Faith is not eaſily attained, but that a continued weight, and exerciſe herein on their ſpirits become unavoidable. And
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:31860:45"/> tho <hi>Sir to one of ſuch a ſpirit, as I know you are off,</hi> there needs little be ſaid of this kind, yet when I look on the face of this <hi>Generation,</hi> even of the more ſerious part of men herein, it would appear that moſt were rather in a <hi>ſleep</hi> and <hi>dream,</hi> then <hi>awake;</hi> elſe were it conceivable, how they could find it eaſie to bear, and ſtand under the weight of <hi>ſuch diſcoveries,</hi> without almoſt fainting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the greatneſs hereof, if they be indeed aſſured of ſuch things as theſe. 1. That within a little time, their eyes are to be for ever ſhut on this earth. and in one moment opened on that <hi>entry</hi> which is <hi>into another World,</hi> and on that hid, and marvelous <hi>paſſage,</hi> which lyes betwixt the <hi>earth,</hi> and the <hi>higher Paradiſe above, which is in the thrid Heavens,</hi> and will then know what it is to ſee with clear, and preceptible evidence ther <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,</hi> and <hi>convoyance</hi> by the <hi>bleſſed Angels,</hi> and the manner of their <hi>aſcent through theſe Aetherial Regions,</hi> in every ſtep of the ſame, their begun acquaintance, and ſociety with theſe <hi>glorious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> which ſhall be without fear, and conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as when they were in the <hi>body,</hi> and at laſt that unconceivable <hi>reception by the bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> now is it poſſible, that men here on the earth can with aſſurance entertain their ſouls with ſuch great things as before them, and near, and yet in an ordinare way converſe with the ſame. 2. Is it a light or ſmall thing to live in the Faith of ſuch a <hi>Triumph,</hi> as is reſerved to each of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:31860:46"/> Saints in the iſſue of their warefare, when the <hi>God of Peace shall tread Satan under their feet,</hi> and ſhall enter them into the <hi>overcomers joy,</hi> with that publick teſtimonie, <hi>well done good, and faithful ſervant &amp;c.</hi> before the whole Church of the redeemed there, and then to be called to a peculiar aſſignment of their <hi>room,</hi> and <hi>ſtation</hi> in that <hi>bleſſed ſtate</hi> anſwerable to their ſervices and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of grace here, when they ſhall ſee the <hi>end of the Lord</hi> in his whole conduct and methods of providence about them within time, which once ſeemed incomprehenſible to their thoughts. 3. Yea what is it to be in the ſerious exerciſe of ſuch a <hi>Faith,</hi> that in a short time there shall be a <hi>final tranſlation of the whole Church militant from this earth</hi> to <hi>theſe higher Regions of glory,</hi> where no more diſtance of place, and but one <hi>Church</hi> and Society for ever, where our <hi>bleſſed Redeemer shall then rejoice in his whole puchaſe,</hi> whom he had bought <hi>at ſo dear a price,</hi> and <hi>preſented with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot, or blemish unto the Father;</hi> and where the whole <hi>elect</hi> from <hi>Abell,</hi> the firſt of humane race, that entred Heaven, and the firſt member of the Church triumphant there, to the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And what a wonder of our <hi>Faith</hi> should it be that ere long this alſo shall be the object of mens ſenſe, <hi>the conflagration of this whole earth; that earth,</hi> on which moſt of the generations of men had ſettled their <hi>Heaven,</hi> to ſee it all <hi>burnt up</hi> before them, and herein the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal isſue of their hopes, and projects upon the ſame, whilſt nothing to ſuch will then further remain, but to enter themſelves into everlaſting

Yea what a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> lyes here, of that <hi>eternal ſeparation</hi> and <hi>parting,</hi> which will then follow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the elect, and reprobate World, with that dreadful <hi>dimiſſion to theſe infernal Regions,</hi> and with this ſight to ſee <hi>ſin,</hi> which made its firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in <hi>Heaven amongst the Angels,</hi> and hath ſince ſo much <hi>overſpread the earth,</hi> now <hi>for ever</hi> shutt up in <hi>hell,</hi> both <hi>ſin, and ſinners together,</hi> never more to look out at the <hi>grate of theſe priſon.</hi>

            <p>But II. There is another thing with reſpect to this <hi>Subject,</hi> which hath been to me oft matter of <hi>ſerious thoughts,</hi> whence is it that in ſo knowing an <hi>age</hi> as this, we ſee how ſuch as are greateſt pretenders to <hi>reaſon, and to a higher flight</hi> then others this way are more viſibly then any elſe of an <hi>Atheiſtick Spirit,</hi> and to be a length herein bejond any elſe on that <hi>deſign,</hi> how to <hi>weaken both their own aſſent,</hi> and <hi>others to the Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and to render the ſame ſo far as poſſibly they can, to be <hi>problematick</hi> and <hi>doubtful;</hi> but it is ſure here is nothing to <hi>ſtumble,</hi> but what may rather be <hi>ſtrenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> to any of a ſerious ſpirit, and needs be no ſtrange thing, when ſuch are as tender as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to marr their enjoiments of this preſent

I have
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:31860:48"/> known ſome whoſe tryalls, and conflicts in their warefare hath been extraordinare, and ſtrange, who hath profeſſed their higheſt releaf ſtill lay herein, from the <hi>Faith of divine truth</hi> more then as to any <hi>particular promiſe made applicable to ſuch a caſe,</hi> and would have ſought no more to carry their ſpirits above the <hi>preſent temptations</hi> that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred though they were not ordinary, or to be at reſt as to all <hi>temporal</hi> events, but a more full ſtrenthning in the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and that their <hi>Redeemer did live,</hi> ſince then they were in <hi>ſure terms,</hi> as to their <hi>ſecurity</hi> for whatever he hath promiſed.</p>
            <p>III. But I muſt add yet one thing further which ſeems indeed a <hi>prodigy,</hi> proper to ſuch an <hi>age as</hi> this, that its become ſo hard a work to bring men living in the <hi>day light of the Ghoſpel to a ſerious beleeving the truth, and exiſtence of infernal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> and of their commerce, and traffick with this viſible World; or to bring ſuch who ſeem greateſt pretenders to reaſon, <hi>to the Faith of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells, lest they should thus be unavoidably brought to that Faith of the Divells, which is to beleeve, and tremble,</hi> which ſurely is an unconceavable and extream <hi>horror</hi> that theſe <hi>Apoſtate Spirits</hi> have herein, whilſt their aſſent to the <hi>glorious beeing of God,</hi> to his <hi>attributes,</hi> yea to the <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>Hiſtory of the Ghoſpel,</hi> is by ſuch ane inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table conſtraint, that as there is no poſſible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs for them to be <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> ſo is their <hi>dréad,</hi> and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:31860:49"/> 
               <hi>torment</hi> heigtned beeing ſuch <hi>knowing intellectual eſſences,</hi> as that power, and ſubtilty of <hi>deluſion,</hi> whereby they deal with mankind will not work on themſelves. This I muſt judge, to be the laſt <hi>effort</hi> of the horrid wickedneſs of this preſent age, to ſtrenthen ſuch a way, and ſince ſuch a party can have no help or ſupport from <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> herein, and yet find the aſſured truth, and beeing of <hi>Divels,</hi> and of their communion, and warefare with men, does marr any poſſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or deſign for <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and a taking off the terror of ane <hi>infernal ſtate,</hi> off their ſoul, they muſt therefore move to another airth, which is to <hi>beleeve nothing but what they ſee and feell,</hi> and comes under a ſenſible demonſtration to warrant the ſame: for this is to make ſure work at once againſt the whole <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and shut the door on any way of conviction thence; thus they keep a diſtance with the beeing of their own <hi>ſouls,</hi> as if it were ſome dark, and abſtract no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe it comes not under their <hi>ſence;</hi> they can live at quiet, and be ſecure from the fear of a <hi>Hell,</hi> and <hi>infernal world,</hi> or excluſion out of <hi>Heaven</hi> untill they once meet with ſuch an <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as to make them both <hi>ſee,</hi> and <hi>feell</hi> the truth hereof; but oh they ſeeme not to apprehend how ſore the application of this <hi>argument</hi> will be, when they at laſt find its in vain to reject the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,</hi> where the <hi>premiſes</hi> are ſure. There is <hi>one</hi> of late, who is come forth in the day light of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:31860:49"/> Chriſtianity, in <hi>a book lately published, to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the World upon ſo great a deluſion,</hi> as to theſe <hi>inviſible powers of darkneſse,</hi> and tho he ſeems to find it difficult how to <hi>annihilate,</hi> and make void wholly their <hi>exiſtence,</hi> yet <hi>doth offer with a ſtrange confidence to ſecure men from any fear of the molestations of ſuch Spirits,</hi> and <hi>that all inward temptations or aſſaults of Satan,</hi> and <hi>his operating upon the ſouls of men,</hi> is but a <hi>deplorable faſcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and bewitchment, that the Chriſtian Church hath been ſo long under.</hi> It might be judged, there were little need for ſuch a worke to take this generation we are now in off all watch, and guard againſt theſe <hi>destroying adverſaries,</hi> and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them more ſecure herein, then they ſeem al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to be; and that this confidence, muſt have ſome ſtrange riſe, to go forth not only in the moſt direct oppoſition to <hi>Sacred Truth,</hi> but to the <hi>univerſal Sence, and reaſon of mankind,</hi> except he hopes to find a numerous party, who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up with both, and will eaſily graſp at ſuch a <hi>bait</hi> tho they should ſee the <hi>hook</hi> that will at laſt deſtroy them. But doe theſe <hi>mighty hunters,</hi> and <hi>destroyers of mankind the Divels,</hi> come ſo little ſpeed in their work this day, that they muſt have a <hi>Protestant Minister</hi> of the Church come forth before the Sun to offer his aſſiſtance to help them forward herein, or if he deny ſuch ane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, what ſecurity will he offer to ſecure men, from a hazard that's more dreadful then the <hi>kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

But there is this <hi>ground,</hi> I muſt judge he ſpecially goes on; that he will be eaſily cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited on ſuch a <hi>Subject</hi> as this, and knowes how ſmall a <hi>patrociny,</hi> will ſerve to promote a deſign for <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and could fall upon nothing, which would be more grateful to a great part novv vvho bear the name of <hi>Protestants,</hi> but whilſt he calls them to lay aſide their <hi>armour,</hi> ſuch as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are expreſly called to put on <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5: 11. will he ſecure them when it comes to the <hi>last battle,</hi> and <hi>conflict, from their beeing ſeaſed by ſuch infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirits in their entry into another World,</hi> whom they did once deride, and that the <hi>truce</hi> which was with them on the earth, will not break

               <p>IT may ſeem ſtrange, not only the lengthning of this <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> ſo far, but in inſiſting moſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon that <hi>Head of the internal Work, and Demonſtrations of the Spirit of God on mens ſoul;</hi> but as I may with humble confidence ſay this was under the ſenſe of ſome <hi>peculiar engagements to ſuch a Subject;</hi> ſo I ſhall make this further <hi>Apology</hi> for the ſame. 1. That <hi>ſince ever I accounted the Profeſſion of Christ a ſerious buſineſs,</hi> I have jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it not conceivable how <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould have ane <hi>aſſent to the truth of the Ghoſpel</hi> or be at <hi>rest</hi> herein, untill it once be brought up to a <hi>full,</hi> and <hi>quieting aſſurance</hi> on that <hi>ſecurity,</hi> to which they muſt <hi>concredite themſelves for ever,</hi> and thus know the <hi>ſtrenth,</hi> and <hi>ſureneſs of the foundation of their Faith</hi> by its <hi>own evidence;</hi> that tho it be not yet <hi>full,</hi> whilſt we are here in <hi>the way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment,</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:31860:51"/> yet is it undoubtedly <hi>full</hi> in the <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>certainty of evidence;</hi> I have judged it alſo an <hi>addition to the greatest joy</hi> which I could have within time, whatever might be a further <hi>ſtrenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſuch a Faith,</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> we are called to by the <hi>Ghoſpel of Christ,</hi> ſo as not to loſe any <hi>frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of this kind, which might tend to a more full eſtabliſhment, and does reckon this the <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,</hi> and <hi>glory of our Religion,</hi> that in no other way it doth require <hi>acceptance</hi> of men, but with a <hi>full aſſurance of underſtanding,</hi> and the furtheſt conviction of evidence; as beeing deſigned no leſs to found a <hi>rational certainty in the judgment,</hi> then to <hi>determine the will or conſent</hi> for embracing the ſame; yea on this account it hath been oft matter of aſtonishment, how in the <hi>teaching,</hi> and <hi>miniſterial work,</hi> which God hath appointed for his Church, the <hi>primary truths of Religion</hi> should not be more held forth to men with that clearneſs of <hi>evidence</hi> and <hi>demonſtration,</hi> as ſuch great, and marvelous things require, and the temper of this age calls for; or how the <hi>great things of God,</hi> that are of the <hi>highest conſequence, and reality,</hi> can have any poſſible reception from men by ane im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite or ordinare aſſent; or whence it is, that with moſt it ſeemes their work ſeems wholly ſett on the <hi>noetick,</hi> when ſo little on the <hi>dianoetick part</hi> of Divinity: but on the <hi>other hand</hi> I muſt alſo wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that if ever I knew what it was to attain ane <hi>inward aſſurance</hi> of the truth, and revelation of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:31860:52"/> Chriſt, and to be at reſt herein; that the <hi>eternal Son of God was revealed from Heaven in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſave lost man,</hi> and that there is a <hi>ſtate of grace here,</hi> and <hi>of glory hereafter;</hi> I have found that no <hi>light,</hi> or <hi>conviction of judgment,</hi> tho with ſuch evidence as could leave no room for doubtfulneſs in the ſame, can effectually work without the <hi>internal evidence,</hi> and <hi>demonstration of the Spirit of God,</hi> and a ſupernatural power both to beget, and ſtrengthen ſuch a Faith in the ſoul; yea that without this, the furtheſt of <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective evidence</hi> to cauſe irreſiſtably a clear and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional aſſurance of divine truth, tho it were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with a <hi>diſpenſation of miracles,</hi> will not <hi>quiet the Spirit</hi> of ſuch, who under <hi>ſome deep ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe</hi> may be haunted with <hi>hid,</hi> and <hi>dreadful temptations to infidelity,</hi> until they know the truth of a <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>evidence,</hi> as goes above any <hi>moral influence.</hi> It is true this is not expreſſible to others, and they muſt <hi>come and ſee,</hi> who would know in what manner the <hi>Spirit of God bears evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> to his own truth, and what <hi>ſtrong impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion his work hath on the internal Senſes of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> yea what <hi>piercing intelligences</hi> are betwixt ſuch, who ſurely know, and are partakers of a <hi>divine life,</hi> and their <hi>bleſsed Head</hi> in this ſtate of mortality, but if this were not known and ſure, we might ſay ane eſtablished Chriſtian whoſe work is to <hi>follow the Lord fully,</hi> and adventure with aſſurance upon him, is ſuch as might be
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:31860:52"/> ſought for here in the earth, but would not be found. 2. If I be perſwaded of the <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>Excellency of Religion,</hi> I muſt ſee this to be of as undeniable evidence, that it hath no true or ſolid intereſt in the Earth, but in the way of <hi>tryal</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> in it's power and efficacy on mens ſoull; and makes no reall ground or conqueſt, by an external profeſſion, or can ſerve to <hi>eternal ends,</hi> until once that radical principle of <hi>the life of God in the ſoull</hi> be underſtood; that choiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany who are now going through time to the <hi>Church triumphant</hi> upon fresh and continued ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of divine aſſiſtance, are theſe alone in whom the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> is kept alive this day on the earth, and it is one of the things I have thought moſt aſtoniſhing in the publick State of Religion, that in an <hi>age,</hi> when reaſon is ſo much preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, men can deſign a <hi>tryall</hi> of the enjoyment of a <hi>Heaven</hi> for ever in another World, and yet hath not the ſame deſign on a perſonal tryall of the enjoyments of grace here, to know converſe with God in the ſpirit, and the certainty of that trade and commerce, which is betwixt Heaven and Earth whilſt we are yet on it, that are things ſo highly remote from all humane ſence. 3. It hath preſt me to inſiſt more on this <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> that this <hi>way</hi> is ſo viſibly gathering ſtrength, and ſeems to have the greateſt prevalence now in the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> how to divide the <hi>moral part</hi> of our Religion in the duties and ſervices
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:31860:53"/> thereof, from its <hi>internal and vital part,</hi> ſo as this mortal contagion hath got in on the light and principles of this Generation, that if there were not an abſolute aſſurance by the promiſe of God, we might fear truth and piety ſhould quickly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish from the earth. Oh what a ſtrange &amp; prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious oppoſition is this! againſt the whole <hi>internal work &amp; vitals</hi> of that <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>excellent Religion;</hi> wherein both the comfort and glory of humane ſtate lyes, &amp; how is't conceivable men ſhould be here capable of converſe with God in the ſpirit, if there were not a conformity to him in the ſame kind by a <hi>participation of the divine nature;</hi> yea if there were not ſo rare a being on the earth as the <hi>new man, which is born of God,</hi> and his immediate workmanship, which hath its peculiar grouth &amp; <hi>vital acts</hi> proper thereto, and in that ſence as it's contradiſtinguished from the <hi>old man cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſin it ſelf,</hi> tho it be formed in the heart of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and hath it's being therein, no more then the <hi>life of God,</hi> which is a partaking of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can put forth any act of ſin, but hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued conflict therewith; and thus tends to give the clear ſence of that Scripture 1 <hi>John 5: 18. we know that whatever is born of God ſinneth not, &amp; Rom 7: 20. It is no more I, but ſin that duelleth in me, nam unumquodque operatur ſecundum ſuam formam;</hi> for if this ſtood not ſure, the whole frame of experimental Religion, were an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable riddle.</p>

I doubt not you make the ſame Judgment, and reckoning of this with more advantage then I can reach, that one of the moſt choiſe and weighty exerciſes of a Chriſtian, whilſt he is within time, lyes in a <hi>deep and ſerious obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the times</hi> he is fall'n in, not only with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the adminiſtration of Providence in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affairs, but what does more eminently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the <hi>Churches of Christ,</hi> and where their lott is caſt; ſince this is ane eſſential part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as it's alſo one of the moſt choiſe of humane excellencies, to diſcern and <hi>obſerve wiſely</hi> the ways of the Lord. But I can only shew you ſome of theſe things in a short touch, which I have found moſt engaging to ſuch an Inquiry in this day. 1. That as each diſtinct <hi>age</hi> hath a proper <hi>Talent</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thereto, under truſt for obſervation of ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of Providence, wherein the name of God is more near unto men in any ſingular way, then in the ordinare courſe of his actings, ſo hath the great <hi>Author of time</hi> choiſed to put a <hi>higher Glory upon one age,</hi> and <hi>period of time, then another,</hi> wherein it might be ſaid that the meaſure of one is <hi>five Talents,</hi> as to more ſolemn appearances of the Majeſty of God in his Providential Actings, when the meaſure of other times hath been this
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:31860:54"/> way but as <hi>two Talents.</hi> Such a differencing marke had that <hi>age of the Churches coming out of Egypt,</hi> beyond all which had gone before; yet was this comparatively little with reſpect to that glory, which was reſerved to the <hi>fulneſs of time,</hi> when our bleſt Redeemer did appear to the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And it's clear how in theſe later times, that <hi>age</hi> which had it's firſt entry from the <hi>Year</hi> 1517. had a higher ſplendor put thereon, then had been known for a <hi>thouſand Years</hi> proceeding the ſame; but when I have thought on the way and conduct of Providence, and marvelous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of God herein to this Generation, I could not but ſee ſomething in a moſt ſingular way of his appearance before the World to the ſame, as ſeems but yet little underſtood, tho this may be ſeen, that we have ſurely lived in an <hi>age of wonders</hi> 2. I have lookt on ſuch an exerciſe, to <hi>diſcern, and underſtand aright the times we are in,</hi> as one of the moſt ſingular means for ſtrenthning a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Faith</hi> on the certainty of ſacred truth; when with theſe more immediate diſcoveries of God in the way and adminiſtration of grace by his ſpirit on mens ſoull, which is whelly hid from the World, they can ſee in what manner his truth does viſibly take place, and is atteſted by an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſeall</hi> in the glory of his work before men, and I am perſwaded none thus did ever perſue a more near acquaintance with God, but hath had ſome peculiar ſtrengthning remarks of his way,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:31860:55"/> that have been hid from others, tho of a ſerious ſpirit otherwiſe. 3. It is ſuch who have ſome greater weight of this choiſe ſtudy, and their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits more fully join'd in therewith then others, who may attain more clear diſcoveries of light, for directing them to the <hi>duties</hi> and <hi>work of ſuch a time;</hi> and on this account I fear that there is much yet this day in the dark to us, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, what hath been the <hi>Voice of the Lord</hi> for anſwering the great ends of his Providence, tho it hath been clear and diſtinct, where mens ſpirits were laid open to entertain the ſame. I confeſs it is not ſtrange as to the greateſt part of men this day, tho they keep at the furtheſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from what might bring near an affecting ſenſe of a Godhead to their ſoull in the ways of Providence, who are reſolute not to ſee, or be perſwaded of what doeth torment them hereby, whoſe great ſtudy is to <hi>live without God in the World,</hi> and ſeem emulous of theſe who can be moſt ingenious and expert, to confirm their hearts againſt all that is ſacred. 4. But I am ſure, it is ſomething much higher then any intereſt of men or of Nations, or the greateſt changes in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of humane affairs, which should bear the greateſt weight in this exerciſe to underſtand the times we are in, and for a ſuitable obſervation thereof, if men could once reckon that their great buſineſs in the earth lyes with God, and in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſight of him in the outgoings of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:31860:55"/> ſince the <hi>hidden wiſdom of God in a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> is to be ſeen and ſought out in his <hi>Works,</hi> as well as in his <hi>Word;</hi> it's true <hi>publick Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and the fall and ſetting up of great men are things highly obſervable and momentous, but they are neither ſeen or underſtood, when they make not way for ſome greater ſight of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God,</hi> and the ſignal <hi>retaliations of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> herein, &amp; what peculiar aſpects ſuch ſtrange Revolutions of Providence hath on the <hi>preſent Generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. Though it might ſeem unſuitable to offer any ſpecial Remarkes and <hi>Obſervations</hi> upon this <hi>late time,</hi> to one of ſo diſcerning a ſpirit, of things of that nature; yet knowing how a mutual communication of light, about the Work of God, and his actings in our day, is ſo incumbent a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I shall point at a few things, wherein I have deſired to admire and obſerve the way of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in this <hi>remarkable age,</hi> but in the firſt place more generally touch ſuch a <hi>Head,</hi> ere I ſpeak in ſome particular way thereto.</p>
            <p>1. When we ſee the <hi>ſeries of theſe times,</hi> and different meaſures of tryall and ſervice aſſigned thereto, ſince that bleſſed riſe, and recovery of the Church from Antichriſtian darkneſs, there might be ſeen alſo a <hi>growing increaſe of light,</hi> which in this <hi>age</hi> hath had ſuch ane advance, as it could not but be expected, that the Lord was to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke ſome higher proofs of the improvements thereof
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:31860:56"/> from this Generation then of theſe paſt, after ſuch great things he had done for a full ſettlement of the <hi>Reformed Churches;</hi> when he had opened the <hi>graves</hi> of his people, and ſent forth his <hi>Priſoners by the blood of the Covenant,</hi> &amp; the tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ains,</hi> which once ſeem'd inſuperable; yea when this alſo is an <hi>age,</hi> where in a great concurrence of the <hi>Prayers of the Saints</hi> in times before, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; ſo that, unanſwerableneſs to the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of God herein, and to fruſtrate ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent methods of grace, might expect ſome unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual work of Judgment to follow thereon, and the Lords coming at laſt to a judicial proces and procedure.</p>
            <p>2. We ſee how theſe extraordinar occurrences of this <hi>time paſt,</hi> hath moſt remarkably had a joint reſpect both to <hi>Sacred, and Civil Intereſts, &amp; quoad Fata Eccleſiae, &amp; Imperii humani,</hi> ſo as in that ſence it might be ſaid there hath been a <hi>shaking both of Heaven and Earth,</hi> as to the Churches viſible State; yea ſuch hath theſe <hi>great changes</hi> from the right hand of the moſt high been within the meaſure of <hi>one age,</hi> as men could not poſſibly ſee with the eye of reaſon, without ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſement, tho it brings therewith one of the moſt diſmal remarks of the preſent time, if mens ſpirits be not ſeiſed with a deep and awful ſenſe of the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous Majeſty of God herein, and know there is no ſtability of humane ſtate this day in the earth
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:31860:56"/> but from him alone, who can bring judgement on the greateſt <hi>Nations,</hi> or <hi>Perſons,</hi> above the common courſe of nature, and influence of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes: but oh what intertainment should a di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>penſation of <hi>Miracles</hi> find from the ſpirits of men now, when the <hi>Revelation of Christ,</hi> and <hi>Redemption by his Blood</hi> from Eternal Wrath, hath no greater effects on this <hi>Generation,</hi> and ſo few awak'd with the Glory of ſuch a light.</p>
            <p>3. When I have conſidered this <hi>age,</hi> as that which might have been judged a time of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation for a further advance of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> in the World, which does ſpecially make a time more remarkable, yet how little acceſs hath been herein to ſee the <hi>Work of God</hi> in any <hi>new planting of Churches,</hi> or <hi>inbrirging of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to the Profeſſion of the Ghoſpel, as hath been formerly, but inſtead of <hi>new Conqueſt,</hi> rather a loſing ground, and is a difficult part become to maintain a <hi>defenſive work</hi> in behalf of the truth, and which may be a ſerious remark that in this <hi>age,</hi> one tribe hath as it were been cut off from the Reformed Churches; I mean as to that diſmal State of <hi>Bohem,</hi> where ſome time before had been ſo eminent and flourishing a plantation; it is true there hath been a ſolemn <hi>tide of the effuſion of the Spirit of God,</hi> allotted to ſomeof the Churches in this laſt age, that ſhould be ſtill matter of ſweet remembrance, but it's ſure this day we ſee the <hi>ebb</hi> as low in theſe places, in the life and power of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:31860:57"/> Religion, and no viſible reviving almoſt any where can be heard of the <hi>Churches of Christ;</hi> which yet hath been to me ſo far a hopeful <hi>ſign</hi> of a near <hi>incalling of the Jews,</hi> ſince it will then find the <hi>Gentile Church</hi> in ſo judicial a Period of time, that it ſhall be as <hi>life from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Yet it is ſure on the other hand there hath been moſt ſignal honor and glory put on this <hi>age,</hi> and with a ſpecial reſpect to <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> in as great a harveſt of ſerious and ſolid Chriſtians by the Power of the Ghoſpel, then hath been in any time or place of the Earth, ſince the firſt <hi>three Centuries;</hi> tho not under that ſeall of Martyrdom as was after the Reformation, yet ſuch who ſhined in the truth and power of true Sanctity, and have left a fragrant Savour and remembrance to this day, when moſt of that bleſſed ſtock is now gone, and their room rarely filled up any where.</p>
            <p>5. Yea this further may be matter of ſweet <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,</hi> how many ſuch hath been in this <hi>age,</hi> in whom that ancient greatneſs of ſpirit with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roïck motions in appearing for God, and his truth might be ſeen; for tho they attained not to the <hi>meaſure of the first three,</hi> of our firſt and bleſſ'd Reformers, yet may it be ſaid, within the limits of this <hi>age,</hi> there hath gone off the ſtage innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable inſtances of ſuch eminency of indue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and with that meaſure of power, and of a ſound mind, as might be compared with any of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:31860:57"/> the <hi>Antients</hi> ſince the <hi>Apoſtolick times;</hi> and this is a remark that never faills of Chriſts imparting himſelf in theſe meaſures of his ſpirit to a <hi>Church</hi> in ſuch a time, according to the great <hi>ends</hi> he is to accomplish there.</p>
            <p>6. Though <hi>great changes upon a Nation or Church,</hi> does not want previous and remarkable warnings from the Lord, we have ſeen with what a marvelous <hi>Surpriſal</hi> theſe have occurred to this Generation, that were moſt remote from all humane thoughts, and once not conceivable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the higheſt principles of reaſon, how ever they should have taken place. It is becoming the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God, to have his <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> in ſuch peculiar and reſerved caſes, as the moſt skilled in the ways and depths of Providence are called to be ſtill with a ſilent admiration, when he thus does ariſe, as in theſe times paſt, to do great things which was not looked for.</p>
            <p>7. But how ſtrange and marvelous hath the <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſalls</hi> been of Providence in our day alſo in the way of tenderneſs, and mercy, as well as of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſhould be a moſt ſtrengthning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, if this had been more ſuitably improven; what unexpected and ſeaſonable interpoſitions have been of a divine immediate power, in <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme exigences,</hi> both of the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Chriſtians,</hi> in theſe great changes paſt; and as <hi>Oppreſſors</hi> have grown up to a height of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, how obſervably have <hi>Carpenters</hi> been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:31860:58"/> whence humane reaſon could not have fore ſeen to cut the <hi>horns</hi> of ſuch.</p>
            <p>8. When we can not but ſee with what a ſignal evidence and commiſſion, the ſpotleſs Judgment of God hath gone forth in theſe late times, to all ranks and ſtations of men, eſpecially in the <hi>Iſle of Britain,</hi> there might be alſo ſome peculiar remarke of it's deſign againſt theſe, who were of the <hi>highest Staie,</hi> ſo as no time paſt did ever tend more to <hi>ſeal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> inſtruction</hi> on the ſpirits of great men then of late, to have the fear and dread of God on them, when <hi>Princes might have been ſeen walking on foot, and Servants riding on horſeback;</hi> yea that there is a time of <hi>Gods making inquiſition for blood,</hi> of ſuch who ſeemed moſt ſecure from humane Power, and how this alone comes from a divine hand, when men are <hi>poiſoned in their own cup,</hi> and lays a ſnare to themſelf by which they are caught; it is true a clear <hi>application of Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces paſt,</hi> to the <hi>preſent times,</hi> is not eaſily attained, but I doubt not of a more full light and diſcovery for this end, as will ſilence all oppoſitions, that have been to the intent and Counſell of the Lord in theſe things which have occurred.</p>
            <p>9. It hath been reſerved to our day, to ſee the <hi>Iſſue,</hi> and <hi>great Deciſions,</hi> which have been in theſe ſtrange <hi>Scenes</hi> of Providence, in this age paſt, and to have them now in our ſight in the whole ſucceſſive courſe thereof, and ſurely this might be a great and affecting ſight to ſuch who
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:31860:58"/> are ready to think that God hath forſaken the earth, and walketh only in the circuit of Heaven, when they cannot but ſee what amaſing events hath been of late brought forth by an inviſible and unpreventable conduct of Providence; and to ſee alſo in this late Revolution of the publick State of <hi>Britain,</hi> how by one <hi>great ſurpriſal,</hi> the whole <hi>Popish Meaſures</hi> there which had been of ſo long and painful a contrivance, was as in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment broke and made void, when nothing leſs expected.</p>
            <p>10. It is unqueſtionable, that the Lord does uſually act by <hi>ſecond cauſes,</hi> but there are ſteps alſo of his way wherein he alone appears, and will have them ſeen to be wholly his work, &amp; this now hath eminently appeared in the great transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of theſe <hi>late times,</hi> how bejond any humane power or might, it was a <hi>Standard by the Spirit of God lifted up,</hi> that did viſibly make way for the work he was then accomplishing, and did ſerve ſuch terror on his Adverſaries; yea how theſe who were acted forth to be inſtrumental thus on the ſervice of their day, were directed for that great end to the <hi>quieting of his Spirit</hi> in ſuch a piece of his Work.</p>
            <p>11. And herewith what thoughts of heart may it cauſe now in the preſent ſtate and juncture of things, to ſee ſuch a <hi>Conjunction</hi> in this <hi>Weſtern Part of Europe,</hi> to ſerve the great ends of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that if it had been told our Fathers by
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:31860:59"/> any, they would have been as ſuch who mock, that in the next age, the <hi>Houſe of Auſtria, of Spain, Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> ſhould have a joint intereſt with the greateſt <hi>Princes of the Reformed Religion,</hi> and take the Sword with one conſent againſt ſuch a Party, whoſe Sword hath been ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, and yet ſtill is reaking in the blood of the Proteſtants, yea how this great inſtrument of Judgment, and <hi>Patron of the Romish Interest</hi> ſhould moſt actively make way to defeat his own Projects and Counſel, by an irreſiſtable conduct of Providence.</p>
            <p>This is a great and unuſual <hi>Conjunction</hi> in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affairs, ſuch as the Policy of the <hi>Weſtern Part of Chriſtendom</hi> is hereby caſt in a new mould, wherein we are called to adore God, and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over all <hi>Second Cauſes;</hi> tho it be a <hi>Depth of Providence,</hi> which is yet not opened up; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly herewith ſome <hi>Reflections</hi> on the ſame I cannot wholly paſs. 1. What may be too juſtly feared of an inordinate reſpect to men, and concurrence of viſible means, above what it can bear, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more effectual to cauſe the greateſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſuccor miſcarry, and ſink under this <hi>weight,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> relyances thereon, as if they could ſtand by them ſelf, without keeping in with <hi>God</hi> alone, with that <hi>God,</hi> who is of infinite Power both to hurt &amp; help, whoſe preſence is ever the higheſt Security of a <hi>Nation,</hi> tho the whole World were againſt them. 2. But this alſo looks with confidence &amp; hope, that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:31860:59"/> the Lord is near to give ſome extraordinar demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of himſelf by <hi>Providences,</hi> as this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall not get their eyes shut at, yea that this ſtrange piece of his work, is a prelude and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try on a revolution of the publick State of the World, that ſhall be of a higher extent, then may be apprehended by moſt, and it's ſure when he does begin, he will alſo make an end. 3. I have lookt on this remarkable <hi>ſilence,</hi> and <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence</hi> as to any <hi>publick Deciſion of Providence, this Year past,</hi> when things ſeemed to be in the higheſt <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>of a Criſis,</hi> that hereby the Lord would yet give men time to conſider his Work, and take to heart his Voice by ſuch a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>warning;</hi> and have ſtill obſerved from the records of times paſt, as to his Procedure, that when he was to bring forth ſome great piece of his Work before the World, there hath been as it were an interval of ſilence for a time, &amp; like ſome <hi>Ceſſation</hi> of Providence, which hath preceeded the ſame, and made the time of his <hi>Working,</hi> when it was leſt mens <hi>Expectation;</hi> yea the ſorer a ſtroak hath been when it came, the longer hath a tender forbearance gone before, even when the <hi>hand of Juſtice</hi> hath been lift up, the <hi>wheels ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtand ſtill,</hi> and the publick ſtate of affairs is in a ſtrange manner becalm'd when the Lord is in ſome eminent manner to ariſe according to that <hi>Iſay 42: 14. I have long time holden my peace, I have been ſtill, I have refrained my ſelf, now will
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:31860:60"/> I cry as a travelling Woman &amp;c.</hi> 4. Yea it may be a ſpecial remark, that when the Lord hath ſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally appeared to make this <hi>great revolution in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> effectuall, and to clear the sky and coaſt there from viſible oppoſition, with ſuch <hi>rare prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Providences</hi> for that end, yet is ſo little ground gained by the unite ſtrength of this <hi>Confederacy,</hi> but it was in the one that the Lord did act in an <hi>extraordinar way of Providence,</hi> in the other things doe run more in the ordinare channel of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilbe means. It looks as a <hi>ſign of great Wrath,</hi> that ſuch an <hi>Inſtrument of Judgment</hi> hath had his <hi>chain</hi> ſo far let forth in this day, who might be called not only <hi>Hoſt is Eccleſiae, ſed humani Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris,</hi> by theſe cruelties more then inhumane exerced in the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> and other Parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> but it's fitt the World should know <hi>of</hi> what ſpirit and way the great <hi>Perſecutor of the Proteſtants in this age</hi> is; yea for the Nations about to ſee there is no poſſible <hi>Moral Security</hi> for their <hi>Civil Intereſts</hi> from one whom no eſtablishments of <hi>Laws,</hi> nor that <hi>Law of Gratitude</hi> towards ſuch whoſe Fathers had brought the <hi>Houſe of Bourbon</hi> to the Throne could bind: but as there is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointing and eſtablishing men for judgment, whoſe hand is made ſtrong untill that work be perfited, ſo is the Sin of Britain, and other Reformed Churches, the greateſt ſtrength of this Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
            <p>12. Have we not alſo been called to ſee
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:31860:60"/> ſuch <hi>viciſſitudes of Providence;</hi> that theſe for <hi>whom God had ſometimes most ſignally appeared in raiſing them to the highest greatneſs and power,</hi> as all might clearly diſcern it was his hand alone, that did the ſame; how <hi>in a way no l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>13. It hath been in ſome ſingulare manner alſo, that in this <hi>age</hi> we have been called to ſee <hi>ſin and judgment meet other with</hi> ſuch aſtoniſhing
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:31860:61"/> circumſtances, and ſo viſible a <hi>reſemblance</hi> and <hi>proportion</hi> betwixt the ſame, as the <hi>ſtroke herein pointing as with a finger at the cauſe,</hi> was unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable for a <hi>natural conſcience</hi> to diſcern, and ſee a <hi>just</hi> and <hi>Holy God,</hi> thus made known, and viſible in ſuch <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>tremendous inſtances of his Judgment,</hi> as bejond the rate of <hi>former times</hi> have been <hi>ſet up, as beacons</hi> in our ſight. I muſt join herewith, this <hi>ſad remark,</hi> which hath had a peculiar reſpect to theſe times, that as it's ſure nothing, but <hi>Religion</hi> in the truth thereof can effectually take off men from <hi>ſin,</hi> ſo hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo much as <hi>Religion</hi> been oft made uſe off as the <hi>grand Engine</hi> to ſecure them therein; and what was ſpoke by one of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> hath been more applicable to our <hi>day,</hi> then almoſt any paſt, that <hi>never was ane age more fertile of Religions under a different profeſſion hereof, and never more barren of Religion in the power,</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of the ſame on <hi>mens ſoul.</hi>

            <p>15. I shall but add this more upon ſo <hi>boundleſs a Subject;</hi> that we have been ſpecially called in this <hi>age to ſee ſome unuſual variation in the ſpotleſs ways and methods of Providence about his Church,</hi> and in the <hi>cours of humane affairs from what hath been the manner of his working formerly,</hi> ſo as men could not diſcern his way oft by any <hi>footſteps</hi> or <hi>precedent</hi> of <hi>Providence in times past,</hi> but that ſomething hath been reſerved peculiarly to <hi>our

And tho we but ſee in part hereof, yet may we now know and underſtand upon theſe <hi>times past,</hi> more then ſuch who was then <hi>preſent actors on the ſtage</hi> could reach in diſcerning the <hi>intents of providence</hi> when things were in their <hi>first mould,</hi> as is now clear in their <hi>after tendency</hi> and <hi>reſult;</hi> nor could poſſibly have that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Work of God in ſome parcels</hi> as may be now attained, when it's in a more <hi>full</hi> and <hi>entire frame;</hi> when ſuch a <hi>ſight</hi> is <hi>ſett</hi> before us, as should call to have our <hi>ſouls bowing down with an awful regard and homage</hi> at ſo <hi>august,</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate a diſcovery of the Majeſty of God</hi> in his <hi>Work</hi> and <hi>actings before this Generation.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> III. <hi>Head on this Subject,</hi> that I would offer ſome thoughts on, is as to the <hi>Lords ſingular way of dealing with the publick State of Britain, and Ireland</hi> bejond any other of the <hi>Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> in this <hi>laſt age;</hi> and is indeed a <hi>Subject</hi> of ſerious regard, to conſider what <hi>manner of time</hi> hath our lot been caſt in, and the <hi>meaſure of that talent</hi> for <hi>obſervation,</hi> we ſtand accountable for upon ſuch great and extraordinare <hi>events</hi> as hath occurred: but here I have deſired to have my thoughts <hi>tranſlate,</hi> to what hath been from the <hi>first entry</hi> on ſo marvelous a <hi>ſeries of providence,</hi> about the ſtate of theſe <hi>Nations,</hi> for almoſt <hi>fifty
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:31860:62"/> Years past,</hi> for a more clear proſpect how each <hi>ſtep</hi> herein in its <hi>ſucceſſive place,</hi> and <hi>room,</hi> hath tended to give <hi>light</hi> to another; which I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrict wholly to the more <hi>immediate appearances of God,</hi> from what hath been <hi>mens part,</hi> and actings upon ſuch a <hi>diverſity of intereſts</hi> as might too viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be ſeen to influence many in their <hi>way;</hi> and <hi>offer</hi> but a <hi>few</hi> ſerious <hi>reflections</hi> on the ſame, to one who can more clearly <hi>obſerve,</hi> and diſcern things of that kind.</p>
            <p>1. That it's ſure <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland hath been of late a Theater of ſuch ſtrange and extraordinare viciſſitudes in it's publick ſtate,</hi> from the <hi>Year 38. of this age,</hi> as in no times paſt can be reſembled; what <hi>wonderful Revolu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ions</hi> did then ſucceſſively follow other, and were made the <hi>object of mens ſenſe,</hi> as could not poſſibly have had credit or been a matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> if the ſame should have been foretold, and may juſtly render ſuch a <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of time</hi> unto this <hi>day,</hi> to be matter of aſtonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to any of a ſerious ſpirit. It is true there is no <hi>time</hi> wherein the Lord hath not given ſome more <hi>ſingular diſcoveries of himſelf,</hi> and theſe <hi>changes of providence</hi> which are in the <hi>perſonal caſe of Chriſtians,</hi> and lyes more cloſe and near to their <hi>Senſe,</hi> then things of a <hi>publick concern,</hi> are oft ſo extraordinare as would be not eaſy for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to credit; but it muſt be ſaid what we have ſeen here, and may know of the work and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:31860:63"/> of God in that <hi>Land</hi> can never be a <hi>Subject of ordinary thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It is known how ane <hi>avenging Sword,</hi> which was <hi>bathed in Heaven,</hi> had it's <hi>commiſſion thence,</hi> to go forth againſt both <hi>Britain,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and did not <hi>ceaſe</hi> to perſue it's end until theſe <hi>flourishing Nations,</hi> was made a viſible <hi>field of blood,</hi> yea did not <hi>rest,</hi> until in the righteous, and Soveraign diſpoſal of God, a <hi>potent</hi> and <hi>ſett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Monarchy</hi> there, of a <hi>long deſcent</hi> having no fear, or oppoſition from any <hi>forren power,</hi> was yet <hi>broke,</hi> and made <hi>void,</hi> and did fall in their <hi>high places;</hi> and what ane account this ſhould have been to the World, if it could have been poſſibly ſeen or judged in the <hi>Year</hi> 40. what the 50 <hi>Year</hi> following was to bring forth, and was then in the boſome of ſo ſhort a time.</p>
            <p>3. But when thus the <hi>Lord did once appear,</hi> and go forth in a <hi>judiciary way,</hi> we might ſee how each of theſe <hi>three Nations had their proper share,</hi> and meaſure allotted in the <hi>ſtrokes,</hi> and <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of that time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho in ſome different method and manner; there beeing a more ſingular part aſſigned to <hi>poor Ireland</hi> then, by the Holy and juſt God in that <hi>bloody and terrible Scene,</hi> which was acted there, yet this was in <hi>common</hi> to the <hi>whole of theſe Lands</hi> that it was an <hi>inteſtine Sword,</hi> and not of a <hi>forreiner</hi> that was then call'd for, which
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:31860:63"/> ſpoke the <hi>Judgment</hi> to be the ſorer and more of divine wrath in it; where on part of a <hi>Nation,</hi> is made the <hi>rod,</hi> and <hi>executioner of his judgment on another,</hi> and their <hi>deſtruction</hi> from <hi>amongst themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. If it be conſidered, what <hi>manner of time,</hi> that was of ſo <hi>extraordinare things,</hi> it may be <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,</hi> how this followed a <hi>long and unuſal ſett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led calm,</hi> and <hi>tranquillity,</hi> which had gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the <hi>publick State of theſe Nations,</hi> when ſo great a <hi>flame</hi> had been round about; it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after a <hi>bloody Sword</hi> had done its work in <hi>Germany,</hi> which from the <hi>Year</hi> 30. had brought with it ſuch diſmal effects there; but what would ſeem moſt <hi>aſtonishing</hi> here, that tho a <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>long ſuffering of God,</hi> had in a ſingular manner gone before, &amp; the <hi>treaty of the Ghoſpel</hi> might be ſeen to have a ſmall accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſuch <hi>judicial effects,</hi> with moſt of that <hi>Generation,</hi> when the <hi>Red Horſe,</hi> and its <hi>Rider</hi> went forth to <hi>take peace</hi> from ſuch a part of the <hi>earth,</hi> yet was not the <hi>hight of Profanity, and Atheiſm nor meaſure of ſin then in theſe Nations</hi> come near to ſuch a <hi>degree,</hi> as is now the <hi>meaſure of this time,</hi> or had any ſuch <hi>prodigious appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;</hi> only we ſee not yet what is <hi>coming</hi> to <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. It is not above 40 <hi>Years past,</hi> ſince we might ſee a <hi>powerful ſtate, &amp; commonwealth</hi> both <hi>raiſed</hi> and <hi>formed</hi> in <hi>theſe Nations</hi> on <hi>ſo great a ruine,</hi> had
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:31860:64"/> gone before, and thus ſuch a new and <hi>wonderful Scene of Providence</hi> brought forth on the <hi>ſtage,</hi> which made a <hi>Revolution in the civil ſtate</hi> of that <hi>nature</hi> as <hi>Britain</hi> had never before known, a <hi>State</hi> whoſe <hi>ſtrength</hi> whilſt it ſtood firm was made <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable</hi> both by <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Land</hi> to the <hi>Nations about,</hi> with ſo ſtrong a <hi>tide</hi> of <hi>ſucceſs,</hi> as nothing was able to ſtand againſt the ſame, but all <hi>eſſays,</hi> which tended to an <hi>oppoſition</hi> then, moſt <hi>viſibly fruſtrate,</hi> and no <hi>plots,</hi> or <hi>mine</hi> laid ſo deep and cloſs, which did not <hi>ſpring</hi> upon themſelves who wrought therein; ſuch was the <hi>concurrence of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable things,</hi> and in ſo ſtrange a manner <hi>until they had ſtood o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>6. But when the eyes of moſt every where was aloft, as to the <hi>iſſue of this ſettlement,</hi> and all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane contrivance, or forecaſt put to a ſtand herein, on what ſide the <hi>ballance might cast</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt ſuch <hi>different Parties,</hi> and <hi>intereſts</hi> as was on foot; it was then as with ane <hi>amaſing earth quake,</hi> that the <hi>whole foundation was razed,</hi> and tho it was unqueſtionable that many of a ſerious ſpirit, and deſign in the things of God was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ongſt ſuch, yet whilſt the <hi>date of their commiſſion was once expired,</hi> and keeped not themſelves in the way of mercy, they are at laſt brought to know what it was to have <hi>God</hi> againſt them; <hi>a God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially hating ſin</hi> before whom it is more highly

I will overturn, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>7. It is now that a <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>marvelous change</hi> we may ſee again go over theſe <hi>Nations,</hi> &amp; an <hi>other piece of the Work of God</hi> brought forth on the <hi>ſtage,</hi> and <hi>new Actors</hi> made uſe of herein; which cauſed great thoughts of heart to know, what <hi>aſpect</hi> ſuch a <hi>criſis</hi> might have on the <hi>publick State of Religion;</hi> then was the <hi>Regal Power,</hi> and <hi>Government in Britain, raiſed again</hi> to its higheſt ſplendor and extent, and this change in ſuch a manner accomplisht as the moſt judicious, and diſcerning ſpirits ſtood amaſed to ſee over what <hi>oppoſitions,</hi> and <hi>difficulties,</hi> which ſeemed inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:31860:65"/> this was carried; and that ſurely it was the <hi>ſame hand who threw them down,</hi> which did then <hi>lift them up,</hi> with whom it is eaſie to make a <hi>way where there is none</hi> for any peece of his <hi>Work,</hi> when he goeth forth herein.</p>
            <p>8. But when it might have been hoped and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſuch <hi>extraordinare providences</hi> ſhould work on <hi>theſe who were most intereſſed in this great Reſtauration,</hi> when it was not there <hi>Sword</hi> or Counſel, but the <hi>finger of God,</hi> which wrought the ſame; and that ſurely this might put a more then ordinare weight how to <hi>reſtore the Nations unto God,</hi> who had <hi>reſtored them to the ſupreame Power,</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> over the ſame, loe then was it in the <hi>Room hereof</hi> that theſe things might be ſeen. 1. How the <hi>Sluces</hi> were immediately <hi>let open,</hi> for an <hi>impetuous flood,</hi> and <hi>deluge of wickedneſſe</hi> to break in over the whole <hi>Iſle;</hi> ane <hi>unbridled licence to all immoralities, and impiety,</hi> and no reſtraint but what might tend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the <hi>Kingdom of Jeſus Christ</hi> amongſt men; ſo as theſe <hi>Years past</hi> ſince the 60. hath tended to lay a <hi>lod of guilt on Britain</hi> bejond the <hi>meaſures of any times past,</hi> and is <hi>ſtill lying upon the ſame;</hi> which will be found <hi>ſore</hi> and <hi>heavy</hi> in the iſſue if <hi>Soveraign Grace</hi> do not wonderfully interpoſe. 2. As it was then that ſuch a <hi>criſis</hi> had ſo diſmal and mortal an aſpect there within theſe hights of <hi>Profanity</hi> vvhich did go over <hi>all banks,</hi> &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jond ane <hi>ordinare cure or relief,</hi> ſo there might be

But it was herewith alſo, when it might have been thought, that <hi>God should ſtay his hand</hi> no longer or <hi>forbear,</hi> that the <hi>ſeall of their commiſſion,</hi> whoſe <hi>power</hi> had then the <hi>greatest influence</hi> might be diſcernable to all; that they were aſſuredly <hi>established for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and had ſuch a judicial work under their hand; ſo as the moſt <hi>deſtructive deſigns</hi> of that party for a further <hi>Ruine to the Church,</hi> ſeemed ſtill then to have the greateſt ſucceſs; and no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts or oppoſitions whatſoever could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſame or ſtop it's courſe, until their <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> and the <hi>Epha</hi> was further filled up, but ſuch who did moſt <hi>haſten</hi> to <hi>brake priſon</hi> as it were <hi>before the time,</hi> found their <hi>bondage grew ſtronger</hi> hereby.</p>
            <p>9. But whilſt ſuch was thus at work, and acting ſo diſmal a part on the publick <hi>Theater</hi> of <hi>Britain;</hi> leſt they should reckon that <hi>ſurely God had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the earth,</hi> and that the Cry of ſuch prodigious wickedneſs was not ſo <hi>loud as to go up to Heaven;</hi> then was it that <hi>he came down in a viſible way,</hi> to <hi>make himſelf known,</hi> and <hi>bring near his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:31860:66"/> with a very <hi>tremendous voiee;</hi> then was it that he gave a ſpecial commiſſion to one of the <hi>three great Judgments</hi> the <hi>devouring Peſtilence</hi> to go to the moſt eminent and conſpicous part of <hi>Britain,</hi> and the <hi>publick Seat of the Regal Power and Authority;</hi> and make that <hi>great City deſolate</hi> for a time, and make their dwellings <hi>void of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, in the Year</hi> 65. yea in ane <hi>extraordinare Conjunction</hi> did <hi>double</hi> ſuch a <hi>warning</hi> by putting them in a <hi>flame,</hi> that it might ſpeak as a <hi>publick Herauld</hi> to theſe Nations, and thus give a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cry,</hi> that <hi>when his Wrath was begun to kindle a little,</hi> men might <hi>meet him in the way of his Judgment</hi> ere it come to the utmoſt and a greater wo follow thereon. This ſurely was the voice of God by a moſt <hi>ſtupendous diſpenſation,</hi> and does ſpeak ſtill to <hi>this day,</hi> tho there may be <hi>few now to hear it.</hi> This was a <hi>Entry of Judgment,</hi> and <hi>ſtroke</hi> of that kind on which the Lord did put a moſt diſcernable <hi>impreſs of his Greatneſs,</hi> and <hi>Terror.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. Yet even then after this there was a moſt <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable Pauſe,</hi> and <hi>tender forbearance,</hi> in the way of the Lord to bring <hi>Judgment</hi> a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther length; the <hi>God of Patience,</hi> who does not <hi>eaſily deſtroy the Work of his own Hand,</hi> and bears long ere a <hi>hight of ſin</hi> does extort the <hi>last Stroke of Vengeance,</hi> did then give ſuch a <hi>new breathing,</hi> or long <hi>intermiſſion,</hi> as to any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary <hi>Acts of Judgment;</hi> but did herewith

               </gap>all how this yet would work by a moſt rare <hi>preventing Providence,</hi> in the <hi>diſcovery of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Plot,</hi> which under the ſhadow of <hi>civil Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> had been ſo long hatching, and ripening un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til this <hi>mine</hi> was <hi>ready to ſpring,</hi> to a <hi>viſible Ruine</hi> of the <hi>whole proteſtant Interest in theſe Nations.</hi> This was a <hi>ſingular ſtep of Divine Providence,</hi> tho the ſence hereof may be gone off the Spirits of moſt, wherein he made us ſee that he was yet ſtill watching over theſe <hi>Lands</hi> for their good, when they were not aware and would not only <hi>warn,</hi> by ſo <hi>awakning a Providence,</hi> but turn that <hi>contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi> againſt the <hi>contrivers,</hi> if ſo this might at <hi>last Work,</hi> and anſwer the intent hereof.</p>

This is indeed a peece of the <hi>Work of God</hi> that might bring near the <hi>Senſe of a Godhead</hi> to the conſcience of the moſt ordinare Obſervers, and what ever ſad, and <hi>Judicial ſigns</hi> be too evident this day of the improvment made by moſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yet ſhould it deeply concern us, that the <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Honor of God</hi> in ſo great a <hi>discovery of himſelf</hi> be not <hi>darkned</hi> or <hi>obſcured.</hi> This is a <hi>Work</hi> vve ſee but <hi>in part,</hi> and the <hi>first Scene,</hi> of vvhat is yet further in bringing forth, and can be little knovvn or taken up by the neareſt <hi>events</hi> of Providence untill the <hi>Viſion-Speak,</hi> and the vail be further taken off the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is ſure herein that theſe of the moſt prejudged Spirit at ſuch a <hi>Providence</hi> hath been conſtrained to ſee, that this vvas by an <hi>immediate divine Hand,</hi> contrare to the ordinary <hi>Courſe,</hi> and <hi>Actings of Second Cauſes;</hi> and how ſuch vvho moſt eminently acted as <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments herein,</hi> vvhat ever acceſs or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, they had of <hi>Reſolution, Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> in ſuch a Work, yet vvere then only called forth to ſtand ſtill, and ſee a <hi>higher Power</hi> moving in the ſame, vvho did there <hi>look down as in the morning watch to trouble the Motions of theſe, who were</hi> againſt them, and in an inſtant <hi>took off their Chariot wheels,</hi> and made them knovv it vvas in

            <p>Tho there was nothing common or ordinare in this <hi>stupendous work,</hi> wherein ſuch <hi>incredible occurrences of providence,</hi> did then concurr as might conſtrain the <hi>naturall conſcience</hi> of men to ſee a <hi>ſupernaturall cauſality</hi> herein yet did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things ſpeciallie, meet here to render this <hi>Work of God</hi> more highly aſtonishing. 1.

For tho this had a reſpect. then to theſe <hi>great shakings</hi> which was to come upon <hi>Juda,</hi> and the <hi>Houſe of their Kings</hi> in the entry of their <hi>captivity,</hi> yet may none <hi>bound</hi> the <hi>intent of the Holy Ghost</hi> in this <hi>Prophecy,</hi> as if there only it was to take place, and had not a <hi>Reſpect</hi> to ſome <hi>further accomplishment</hi> of the <hi>ſame</hi> in after times, which ſurely was ſince, never more <hi>clear</hi> in the <hi>event</hi> then in <hi>this late
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:31860:69"/> wonderful Series of Providence,</hi> that hath been in theſe <hi>overturnings.</hi> But now let me ſpeak here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, what hath been ſometimes <hi>deeply affecting,</hi> how there is ſomething yet more <hi>ſolemn</hi> and <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinare now in this thrid call,</hi> then all that hath gone before, to be <hi>awakening to this generation,</hi> and that which with too clear evidence may be judged the <hi>last cry and call,</hi> ſuch as hath no <hi>dark</hi> or <hi>uncertain ſound</hi> therewith to the <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Churches of Britain,</hi> and unto all <hi>ranks</hi> there, if there be not a reſolute ſhutting of our <hi>ear</hi> at the ſame, that this is aſſuredly the voice of the Lord, <q>
                  <hi>I will yet once more</hi> take <hi>proof</hi> and <hi>tryall of theſe Lands, which I did choiſe,</hi> and in ſo ſingular a way deall with bejond other Churches and Nations; and will yet reſpite the laſt ſtroak of Judgment; and if tenderneſs and forbearance in a moſt ſurpriſing and extraordinare diſplay thereof will once work; if the actings of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſuch as could not of late have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved by men will once reclaim, and return Britain and Ireland again unto God, I will then take of both their fetters and fears, and give a new ſettlement to their civill rights and intereſt, will ſeaſe their adverſaries with terror and trembling, and yet ſpare their blood; will ſett ſuch alſo upon the <hi>Throne,</hi> who shall ſeek the good and welfare of their People, under whoſe shadow ye may ly down ſafely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dread either of the terrors by night or ſuch

               <hi>A</hi> IV. <hi>Head,</hi> on this <hi>ſubject;</hi> which I muſt join in with the former, that is of great <hi>weight,</hi> and <hi>conſequence,</hi> is this; to know what <hi>aſpect, ſuch extraordinary providences of theſe times past,</hi> now hath on the churches there, and whither ſo <hi>great a criſis,</hi> as hath been in the <hi>publik State of affairs,</hi> hath more <hi>promiſing,</hi> or <hi>threatning ſigns,</hi> therewith. It was the higheſt part of <hi>Hezekiah obſervation,</hi> upon that <hi>great deliverance</hi> he met with <hi>Iſai.</hi> 39. not to ſee only <hi>God in his immediate hand</hi> herein, but how his <hi>heart,</hi> was toward him in the ſame; as is there expreſſed <hi>thou hast loved my ſoul, out of the pit of corruption,</hi> for ſo does the <hi>originall</hi> render it. <hi>A looſing ſight of providence,</hi> in what the Lord doth ſpeak to men thereby, maketh way not only for great <hi>shakings,</hi> but to <hi>read the ſenſe thereof, contrair to its intent;</hi> and tho there be a regarding by all, the <hi>viſible effects of providence,</hi> and what herein lyes neareſt to our <hi>ſenſe,</hi> yet few goes a further length in their <hi>obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi> It is undenyable that an extraordinare condeſcendence of <hi>grace,</hi> and of the <hi>long ſuffering of God,</hi> might be ſeen in theſe great things here done of <hi>late,</hi> but the <hi>next enquiry</hi> lyes here, how ſuch ane <hi>unuſual application of providence</hi> does work? It was upon ſome <hi>ſerious thoughts</hi> hereof, and this <hi>preſent State</hi> of things, I <hi>ſett my ſelf,</hi> for more clear diſcerning of the <hi>way of the Lord</hi> and his <hi>voice to this generation</hi> in theſe <hi>aſtonishing
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:31860:70"/> changes</hi> hath gone over the ſame <hi>of late,</hi> to have <hi>my own ſpirit fix'd</hi> herein, and ſome higher ſtrenthning on the <hi>faithfulnes of his truth;</hi> but in the <hi>firſt place,</hi> there are ſome undoubted <hi>principles of truth,</hi> which I would mention here, and muſt <hi>hold by,</hi> as <hi>truths</hi> which are of ane <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall verity,</hi> and may have a clear <hi>applicatory light,</hi> to the <hi>preſent day</hi> we are in.</p>
            <p>1. That it's ſure, the <hi>moſt notable mercies</hi> which hath been bequathed of the <hi>Lord,</hi> either to <hi>churches,</hi> or <hi>perſons,</hi> have alſo been an <hi>entry to the greatest of judgements,</hi> when <hi>not anſwered,</hi> it was with the brighteſt ſunshine of ane <hi>immediate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of his hand,</hi> and ane <hi>extraordinary courſe of miracles,</hi> that <hi>Iſrael, entred into the wilderneſs;</hi> whereon ſo black a night of <hi>diſmal providence:</hi> did fall; and is it not the ſame <hi>voice</hi> which is now ſpeaking to us, that we have <hi>Malach. 2. 2. if ye will not lay to heart, to give glory to my name, ſays the Lord of host, I will curſe your bleſſings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It ſtands ever <hi>ſure,</hi> and <hi>unchangeable,</hi> that <hi>God will never return to a people,</hi> againſt whom he is wroth, untill <hi>the cauſe of his departure be taken away,</hi> for both the ſame <hi>date,</hi> and <hi>meaſure,</hi> which mens <hi>forſaking of God,</hi> doth <hi>bear,</hi> the ſame alſo does <hi>his departing bear</hi> unto them, and tho <hi>repentance</hi> where it is in truth, can never be in vain, yet may it come to <hi>late,</hi> to <hi>prevent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral judgment,</hi> or to regain ever again, a <hi>ſeaſon
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:31860:71"/> of acting for God,</hi> when there is a more eminent <hi>call</hi> thereto, at <hi>one time,</hi> then <hi>another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It is ane <hi>unchangeable truth,</hi> which varies not, with the changes of time, <hi>that there is no condition on the earth can be ſafe</hi> whither as to a a <hi>Nation,</hi> or <hi>Perſon,</hi> were it never at ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, in external things; <hi>wherein they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, God is with us herein,</hi> and <hi>we are deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for him;</hi> as on the other hand, it muſt be founded wholly on <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> where the <hi>ſtate;</hi> and <hi>danger of a Nation is not judged from the ſins</hi> thereof, and the <hi>meaſure</hi> of the ſame, more then from any <hi>viſible hazard;</hi> for tho particular <hi>places,</hi> and <hi>people,</hi> under a Profeſſion of Chriſt, comes not to the ſame <hi>hight in filling up the meaſure of ſin;</hi> yet it muſt ſurely have it's <hi>fatal period,</hi> when <hi>deferred Judgment</hi> will nat ſtay on <hi>day</hi> longer.</p>
            <p>4. What ever uncertainty be in humane things, yet is this <hi>unchangeable,</hi> and <hi>ſure,</hi> that <hi>ſuch who inherit the ſame ſins of others,</hi> againſt whom <hi>God</hi> hath appeared in any <hi>eminency</hi> of <hi>Providence shall inherit the ſame Judgements;</hi> which hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been meaſured out to ſuch as hath gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but are <hi>pledges to after times</hi> of what may be expected. For as the <hi>way of grace,</hi> changeth not, and the <hi>redeem'd of the Lord, as dear to him now, as ever;</hi> ſo is he <hi>immutably juſt,</hi> and his ways keeps the ſame meaſure with his revealed truth, ſo as a <hi>Solid Interpretation of Scripture</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:31860:71"/> needs no extraordinare <hi>Prophetik Spirit,</hi> to <hi>infer Judgment,</hi> from <hi>ſin,</hi> where there is no ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning unto him, and <hi>when the Lord God hath ſpoken, who can but Prophecy Amos</hi> 3: 8.</p>
            <p>5. It is of unqueſtionable evidence alſo, that <hi>national ſins,</hi> wherein the <hi>body of a Nation,</hi> and <hi>People is unite,</hi> and hath a joint acceeſſion herein; when it is thus the <hi>publick Sin of a Community,</hi> muſt meet with a <hi>Stroke,</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> within time of as <hi>publick extent,</hi> and cannot be laid over in <hi>this reſpect to the Judgment of the great day,</hi> when once it's <hi>meaſure is filled up here;</hi> ſince elſe the <hi>Glory of God in his truth,</hi> and <hi>remunera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juſtice,</hi> should not have on ſuch an account, a <hi>Vindication</hi> before the World, in the <hi>ſight of Angels,</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> if his <hi>ſpotleſs Judgment</hi> should not thus bear ſome <hi>proportion,</hi> to the <hi>nature of that guilt;</hi> the <hi>God of truth</hi> hath given his <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Dominion,</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> over <hi>Nations</hi> both to <hi>pluke up,</hi> and to <hi>plant,</hi> as well as over <hi>perſons,</hi> which can never be made void.</p>
            <p>6. There can be no doubtfulneſs here alſo that it is ſimply impoſſible for a <hi>church to ſubſist,</hi> or <hi>preſerve ît's ſtation</hi> in a <hi>Church state</hi> by a naked <hi>external form</hi> only; or in the <hi>purity of religion,</hi> without ſome <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> of the ſame; ſince if there were no reall <hi>inbringing,</hi> or <hi>building</hi> up of the <hi>elect</hi> there, then the <hi>Goſpel</hi> had no more work in the ſame, and no <hi>interest</hi> were there for the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> to keep fellowship with; ſo that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:31860:72"/> the <hi>intrinſick ſtrength</hi> of any <hi>particular church,</hi> yea of the <hi>politick bodie</hi> therein; lyes not in the <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> or <hi>bulk,</hi> but in the <hi>weight,</hi> nor is't the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive growth</hi> of a <hi>church</hi> to a viſible profeſſion that makes, a <hi>reall increaſe;</hi> but how great an <hi>interest</hi> does a <hi>few</hi> ſuch, whoſe way is the <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>power of that doctrine they profeſs,</hi> make in the <hi>place</hi> they are in; tho this ſeems litle apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, what <hi>influence</hi> the <hi>hid part in a nation</hi> of <hi>humble, ſerious chriſtians</hi> hath on the <hi>external State</hi> thereof, and on the <hi>adminiſtration of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the world,</hi> who makes <hi>least appearance</hi> in it, by a near entercourſe with <hi>heaven,</hi> and by ſuch <hi>high value,</hi> and regard which they have there, ſo as the <hi>Lord</hi> hath even <hi>ſubjected</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <hi>viciſſitude</hi> and <hi>changes</hi> of the <hi>time</hi> to the <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and prayers of ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me but <hi>add</hi> this herewith, that tho the Lord does ever <hi>diſtinguish</hi> betwixt the <hi>Godly,</hi> and the reſidue of men in times of <hi>publick calamity,</hi> and <hi>Judgments,</hi> ſo as not to lay them <hi>common</hi> herein with the <hi>wicked,</hi> yet on the other hand, it is not a <hi>numerous Party,</hi> even of moſt <hi>choiſe,</hi> and <hi>Reall Chriſtians</hi> in a <hi>Land,</hi> will ſtand in the way of <hi>wrath,</hi> and of ſome diſmal ſtroke, when the ſett <hi>time of Judgment</hi> is once come; but may be then ſuch with a <hi>Nation,</hi> when there is no more hearing, or <hi>interceſſion,</hi> but for that <hi>inſtance</hi> of the Lords ſiſting his judgment, if there had been but 10 <hi>Perſons</hi> in the <hi>Cities of the Plain:</hi> it
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:31860:72"/> was an eminent return to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinar act of condeſcendence, that makes no <hi>rule.</hi> There was a choiſe and numerous <hi>remnant</hi> in <hi>Judea,</hi> who ſought the Lord then, when that diſmal night of the <hi>Captivity</hi> came on; and it is of late, that ſuch a <hi>tremendous inſtance,</hi> we have before us in the <hi>Caſe of Bohemia,</hi> where ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicous a part then was of a <hi>People zealous for God,</hi> when ſuch a <hi>publick overwhelming ſtroke</hi> came on.</p>
            <p>But now in the <hi>Second Place</hi> I muſt ſpeak a <hi>few words</hi> to what ſeems in ſome ſingular way, to ſpeak to <hi>Britain,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> by very ſad, and <hi>monitory ſigns,</hi> bejond any of the Churches ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: it is, I know, eaſie, and uſual to challenge the <hi>darkneſs of Providence,</hi> more then to regard, what is clearly revealed to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the <hi>intent &amp; voice</hi> thereof; and theſe are indeed ſad, and diſmal like <hi>dispenſations,</hi> that tho they be not <hi>ſilent,</hi> but have a <hi>diſtinct,</hi> and <hi>audible voice,</hi> yet <hi>Seals no Instruction</hi> herewith, on the ſpirits of men. I confeſs a <hi>natural Reſpect,</hi> and <hi>tye,</hi> to ſuch a <hi>Part of the earth,</hi> bejond any elſe, renders this to ſome, to be more <hi>heavie,</hi> and <hi>dreadful</hi> that if <hi>Soveraign grace,</hi> do not wonderfully interpoſe, it cannot be found in the <hi>courſe of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> ſince the beginning of time; that ever the <hi>meaſure of ſin, contempt of a Deity,</hi> and <hi>oppoſitions to the Holy God in the deſigns</hi> both of his <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> hath come to ſuch a hight as is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

            <p>2. And as to one ſpecial <hi>evidence</hi> hereof, what cauſe may it be to <hi>meditate terror,</hi> as to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of <hi>theſe nations,</hi> when a <hi>ſpirit of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> is let forth there and gott ſuch a prevalence amongſt all <hi>ranks,</hi> as it's accounted a matter of <hi>fashion,</hi> and <hi>breading,</hi> to go a length bejond o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in tearing that <hi>bleſſed name of God,</hi> in

            <p>4. And do we not with too great <hi>evidence</hi> now ſee, how much that <hi>old Proteſtant ſpirit,</hi> which was in the <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>life of that profeſſion,</hi> is gone, and extinguiſhed this day; before which the <hi>Romish interest</hi> could not, poſſibly ſtand, when <hi>humane power</hi> and <hi>might</hi> did litle concur therewith; ſo as it may be a ſtrange but too viſible a <hi>remark,</hi> how that <hi>diſtinction,</hi> hath got ſuch place in <hi>Britain,</hi> bejond any other <hi>reformed churches</hi> elſe, which is betwixt the <hi>Proteſtant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,</hi> and <hi>politick concerns</hi> thereof, and the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> which lyes in the <hi>pure doctrine of Christ,</hi> in its <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>efficacy on mens ſoul,</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:31860:74"/> and <hi>practice;</hi> when thus may be ſeen, what a throng and eaſie concurrence is there to <hi>promote the one,</hi> and bear the higheſt reſpects thereto, ſo far as they find a <hi>private interest,</hi> and <hi>external motives</hi> renders this neceſſary, who does <hi>hate,</hi> and to the utmoſt <hi>oppoſe themſelves to the other;</hi> yea fears nothing more, then to have this get any <hi>authority over their conſcience;</hi> and oh thence it is that when <hi>priveledge</hi> and <hi>propertie</hi> upon a temporal intereſt, are as the <hi>apple of mens eye,</hi> when theſe are once touched, yet are the higheſt <hi>indignities,</hi> and <hi>affronts to the honor of God,</hi> and to his <hi>truth</hi> of a ſmall regard.</p>
            <p>5. But if we yet look further, in to the <hi>Publick State of Religion</hi> in theſe <hi>Churches,</hi> there may be a more aſtonishing <hi>ſight,</hi> and of <hi>greater abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> ſtill, anſwerable to <hi>that viſion Ezechiel</hi> 8; when within the precincts of a <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> once ſo purely <hi>reformed,</hi> ſuch a <hi>party</hi> is got up and growing, whoſe work is not onlie to take men off the ſerious work, and power of <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> but to ſubvert wholly the <hi>foundation of</hi> our <hi>faith,</hi> under that late deſignation of <hi>Deiſts,</hi> and that men are now become ſo wearied of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Profeſſion,</hi> as were their power anſwerable to their will, they would bring in a new model of <hi>paganiſm,</hi> and fix themſelf at laſt there. And oh is it come to ſuch a day, after ſo bright a ſun shine of the Goſpell hath gone before, and after ſo great ane <hi>effuſion of the Spirit of God,</hi> that ſuch
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:31860:75"/> a party should be upon the encreaſe in ſo horrid an appearance, were it poſſible, to make void the whole <hi>frame of the Goſpel,</hi> to juſtle our ever <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Redeemer,</hi> who once was the <hi>deſire of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> off his throne, to thruſt the <hi>crown off his head,</hi> the <hi>ſcepter of whoſe goverment</hi> is <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp; <hi>peace;</hi> and give, if they could, a mortall ſtroke to him, who is the <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>light of men,</hi> and by <hi>whoſe ſtripes we are healed,</hi> yea as if they could make their party good againſt that rod of iron, with which he bears rule over his adverſaries. But what can theſe deſign to themſelves to render <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane being</hi> deſirable here on the <hi>earth,</hi> except to have a ſhare of the ſame priveledge, with the <hi>beaſts,</hi> of <hi>the field,</hi> that within a little they should have no more <hi>being,</hi> and oh <hi>what a God</hi> does ſuch deprive themſelves of who only <hi>propitious,</hi> to poor man in <hi>Christ,</hi> and otherwiſe not the object of our <hi>trust,</hi> but of terror; yet is this way now come to that length, as it would ſeem to deſpiſe all <hi>moral releef.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. I muſt yet <hi>add</hi> here, tho it be a very ſad ungrateful <hi>Subject,</hi> how we are faln in a <hi>day,</hi> when the greateſt diſcoveries of <hi>God,</hi> both in the way of <hi>Judgment,</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> ſeems to have no affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting ſenſe, or regard on this generation, and the great deſigns both of <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>providence</hi> amidſt ſuch marvelous changes hath gone before, in that manner withſtood as moſt ſeemes to unite there ſtrength herein; even when this may be in a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:31860:75"/> ſingular way applicable to <hi>our time,</hi> what the Lord did once ſpeak to <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Moſes; your eyes have ſeen the great Acts of the Lord,</hi> and theſe <hi>great temptations, the Signs,</hi> and <hi>Wonders,</hi> which he hath done in this <hi>last age;</hi> yet if Soveraign grace do not marvelouſly appear, it may be fear'd, that both the <hi>voice of God</hi> in his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> hath discharg'd their commiſſion, without any due regard to the ſame; and that judgment, and mercy after ſuch extraordinar methods of divine patience have done their part, and is now come to ſuch a <hi>judicial</hi> withdrawing, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that <hi>great Ambaſſador,</hi> the <hi>Spirit of God from his Church,</hi> that there ſeems but ſmall acceſs to ſerious <hi>Publick Humiliation,</hi> and <hi>faſting,</hi> or to call for <hi>ſolemn Aſsemblies</hi> for this end, except to <hi>Perſonate, &amp; Act ſuch a part</hi> as that of the <hi>mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Women amongst the Jews at Funerals,</hi> and amongſt theſe of the moſt <hi>ſerious Spirit</hi> in this day, ſuch a reſtraint may be found of that <hi>Serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and fervor herein which once did appear, as renders it a more <hi>ominous Preſage</hi> that there may be nothing to follow but that laſt ſentence, <hi>let them alone;</hi> and muſt not all thus reaſon and judge, that as the intereſt of <hi>Sacred Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Honor,</hi> and <hi>Glory of God</hi> in mens ſubjecting thereto is of much higher value then any <hi>temporal Interest;</hi> ſo is the <hi>Vindication</hi> of the ſame before the World of a greater concern then the <hi>ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> or <hi>ſtanding of Kingdoms,</hi> yea to fear more
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:31860:76"/> deeply that ſuch a <hi>time,</hi> how long ſo ever defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, muſt at laſt take place, when his ſpotleſs procedure of <hi>Judgement,</hi> ſhall be then cleared fully; <hi>shall I not viſit for theſe things, shall not my ſoul be avenged on ſuch</hi> a People.</p>
            <p>But now in the <hi>third Place,</hi> there is <hi>one Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> that ſhould ly near, and hath a more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>call</hi> for the ſame in ſuch a day; to <hi>know what is yet left,</hi> and acceſſible in the <hi>matter of duty,</hi> that might be as a <hi>door of hope</hi> for the <hi>Lords Returning</hi> once more, and his reſpiting of <hi>imminent Judgement,</hi> when ſo <hi>great a Ruine</hi> is like to fall under the <hi>Hand of this Generation.</hi> I know any ſuch thing will be to moſt as matter of deriſion, whoſe <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>hopes</hi> of this kind goes no higher then <hi>preſent Objects of Senſe,</hi> and it is little I can adventure to ſpeak hereon, but as to any <hi>meaſure of light</hi> I have attained, I can no more queſtion, that the ſame voice <hi>from the Lord,</hi> is <hi>now going forth</hi> to the <hi>Churches of Britain,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> then that I read what is <hi>ſpoke</hi> to <hi>Juda Ezechiel 22: 30. And I ſought for a man amongst you that should make up the hedge, and ſtand in the gate before me for the Land, that I should not deſtroy it, but I found none; therefore have I poured out my indignation upon them, I have conſumed them with the fire of my Wrath, their own wayes have I recompens'd on their Heads, ſays the Lord God.</hi> It's ſure then <hi>wrath</hi> was near to a breaking forth, when this <hi>last call</hi> came yet with an <hi>offer of Peace,</hi>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:31860:76"/> nor is it queſtionable there was a ſerious part then who were deeply affected with ſuch a time, tho it was not eaſy to find one of a <hi>truly raiſed ſpirit,</hi> to do and endure ſomething more then ordinare for God, when ſo great a <hi>ruine</hi> was ready to fall under their hand; but to clear the <hi>import of ſuch a call,</hi> with reſpect to the publick State of the <hi>Churches of Britain,</hi> under this <hi>alluſion,</hi> here made uſe off, to ſtand in a <hi>gape and breach,</hi> when the <hi>Church as a defenced City</hi> is laid open to an extream and imminent hazard; I muſt ſpeak a few things to be conſidered, what muſt follow if no <hi>Interceſſor</hi> be found, to anſwer the voice of this <hi>call,</hi> by a ſuitable appearance herein.</p>
            <p>1. Tho it may be now reckoned, that the sky is more clear as to the <hi>State of Britain,</hi> then for many Years paſt, when the <hi>breach</hi> ſeems to be made ſure againſt either <hi>Forrain or inteſtine Aſſaults,</hi> and that in the way of reaſon and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinare courſe of humane affairs, things are come to a more ſecure and ſettled State, yet is there an other <hi>aſpect</hi> of things, that ſhould deeply affect our ſpirits, when the <hi>publick hazard</hi> of the time is greater then from all <hi>humane power,</hi> and the party to be moſt feared, is aſſuredly <hi>divine Wrath,</hi> after a long interval of forbearance, that is ready to break forth in ſome extraordinar <hi>Acts of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> for where a day of <hi>attonement</hi> goes not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, can no true deliverance be expected, to raiſe and ſettle theſe <hi>Nations;</hi> yet how rare are
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:31860:77"/> they who take this to heart, or tremble within themſelf on the thoughts of <hi>Judgment</hi> to be near, if it does not appear from <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>viſible cauſes,</hi> tho nothing be more diſcernable from <hi>Moral Signs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. What ever preſent calm be from theſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and fears that have been of late, yet may it be judged whither it be a ſerious buſineſs, or not to <hi>ſtand in ſuch a breach</hi> as is this day, when the greateſt intereſt of our <hi>Faith,</hi> is laid open to ſuch numerous aſſaults; as there ſeems no leſs cauſe to ſtand, and contend for the <hi>Chriſtian Cauſe and Interest</hi> now in theſe <hi>Nations,</hi> againſt ſuch who are under a viſible Profeſſion of the ſame, then once was againſt the <hi>Heathens;</hi> whilſt that <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Spirit,</hi> which was then a <hi>Spirit of Power</hi> and of <hi>Glory,</hi> does too rarely appear, or theſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of grace in ſuch impreſſions as was then that are under a ſad and judicial reſtraint; moſt being taken up ſo entirely with private refent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of perſonal Injuries, and bitter in eſtine conflicts, as the ſound of ſuch a hazard cannot be heard, until it be felt. It was the Power and Evidence of Chriſtianity on mens ſoull, that did firſt make <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and made way for the planting &amp; ſettlement of the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> but it would ſeem now reckoned that the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Interest</hi> can ſtand, tho the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> were extinct in the power and vitalls thereof, and might eaſily be given up by the greateſt part of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:31860:77"/> this <hi>Generation,</hi> if it's <hi>outworks</hi> could be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, where a <hi>temporal Interest</hi>

               </gap>enders that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſar; whilſt that <hi>magnetick power and vertue,</hi> which the <hi>Truth</hi> once had on the World is not to be ſeen, or any deep ſence of that Intereſt which Religion once had in the <hi>Glory of a paſſive Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> for the ſame.</p>
            <p>3. Is not the <hi>gape</hi> and <hi>breach,</hi> we have to ſtand in this day. of ſuch a kind, that where the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Love of theſe renowned Churches,</hi> the <hi>Love of their Youth,</hi> and <hi>Kindneſs of their Eſpouſals unto God,</hi> did ſo brightly ſhine forth after the <hi>Reformation from Popery,</hi> it is now reſolved unto ſo diſmal a change, as with moſt what ever is moſt lovely, excellent, and deſirable in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Ghoſpel,</hi> and ſhould have the moſt attractive influence on mens ſoull, is viſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed and vilified; yea which renders this <hi>breach</hi> and <hi>gape</hi> more dreadful, that after all the <hi>cost</hi> &amp; <hi>expence</hi> which the Lord hath wared in planting, and letting forth a <hi>vine yard to Britain,</hi> ſending moe Servants then at the firſt with the indearing perſuaſives of the Ghoſpel, and on the other hand with ſolemn and expreſs warnings of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of ſuch <hi>Strokes of Judgment,</hi> to come, as hath been afterwards felt; yet hath the return been in a continued and growing enmity againſt the truth, and inſtead of rendring the fruits of this <hi>Vineyard</hi> in its ſeaſon, hath rather conſpired to deride and deſpitefully uſe ſuch as have come to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:31860:78"/> demand the ſame, and what can be judged will be the reſult hereof, if men have not concluded that God hath forſaken the earth; can it be thought that the <hi>Breaches of theſe Nations</hi> ſhall be bound up, but that they muſt widen further, if there be not in ſome ſingular manner a ſtanding up in this <hi>breach,</hi> to turn away his wrath; which is a ſervice that comes now under our hand, as may not linger or ſtay, when warnings of ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar a kind are reinforced; for this is a <hi>call,</hi> hath a <hi>limited time and ſeaſon</hi> allotted thereto, that may have a <hi>shorter period</hi> then we apprehend when a door of <hi>Interceſſion</hi> hath been in ſuch unuſual manner kept open, and <hi>Grace</hi> hath ſo long inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, before <hi>Judgment</hi> should come to a final execution.</p>
            <p>4. I muſt add hereto what ſence ought to be of the hazard of ſuch a <hi>breach,</hi> when a hight of all <hi>Immorality and Ungodlineſs</hi> is turned ſo open and viſible, as if <hi>Sathan</hi> did eſſay to have an <hi>open Throne</hi> again ſet up, as once he had amongſt the <hi>Nations;</hi> whilſt the ſpirit of few are ſeaſed with any ſuitable impreſſion of the ſame, leſt this be the voice of the Lord without recalling, <hi>shall I not viſit theſe things, shall not my ſoull be avenged on ſuch a Nation Jer.</hi> 5: 9. and what a time is it, when the <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Authority of Religion</hi> is ſo far gone off mens ſpirits, that if ſuch can bring up a private intereſt, and have ſome treaſure of that kind laid up, they are under no fear of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:31860:78"/> up Wrath and Judgment; it was a rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that of <hi>Daniel,</hi> who upon the foreſeeing of a ſtroke which he was not to fear for himſelf, yet <hi>was aſtonished for ane hour, and his thoughts troubled him,</hi> by reaſon of the ſtrangenes of it <hi>Dan</hi> 4: 19. That there is a moſt choiſe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious part yet in theſe <hi>Nations</hi> as is this day in the earth, is unqueſtionable, but even ſuch who in theſe <hi>difficult</hi> &amp; <hi>perillous times</hi> paſt, have been helpt to ſtand, and go through a variety of <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>ſtrange Diſpenſations,</hi> I ſuppoſe have not found a time in a more ſingular way <hi>trying</hi> in the <hi>matters of Conſcience,</hi> then is this day; and that there was never more hazard of an inſenſible wearing out from under former impreſſions of <hi>duty</hi> and the <hi>ways of truth,</hi> which once they had, or a more difficult part to have that <hi>ancient fear,</hi> and <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of light</hi> kept in exerciſe which as the <hi>apple of the eye,</hi> may be eaſily hurt, but not ſo eaſily helped.</p>
            <p>But tho it is clear that this voice and <hi>call</hi> for <hi>ſtanding in the gape and breach,</hi> does reſpect all of a ſerious ſpirit in the things of God, yet are there ſome more eminently fitted from the Lord with peculiar Excellencies on their ſpirit then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to appear on ſo high a ſervice; which as it is a talent not bequeathed in vain, where this in a more remarkable way is let forth, ſo is it of greateſt weight to know <hi>time</hi> and <hi>opportunity</hi> for this end, and when a <hi>ſeaſon of Providence</hi> may
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:31860:79"/> call to ſome higher improvement hereof for God, then ever again may occur; yea it may be ſeen in how ſtrange a manner the choiſeſt inſtruments in the ſervice of their day, are made to differ not only from others, but from themſelves, as they are helped to anſwer ſuch a <hi>call,</hi> and to know the Counſel of God herein. But that I may touch this more particularly, it is requiſite to know who may be at the greateſt advantage, and in a nearer capacity then others for ſuch a ſervice, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which I judge theſe things will not be queſtio<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nable. 1. That ſuch as have a more <hi>near and intimate converſe with God</hi> in this day, hath a great room alſo in this ſervice, to ſtand in ſuch a Gape, yea to ſave a <hi>Kingdom or Nation,</hi> when Judgment is ready to break forth; theſe have their Soull kept in that manner under the power and attractions of the things of God, bejond the reſidue of men, as not to be affrighted or taken off from appearing for him by the force and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of <hi>example;</hi> it is theſe who are at moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to diſcern the <hi>Judicial Removes of the preſence of God from the Church,</hi> and the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration they live amongſt, and the imminent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of Wrath, and approaching Judgment; yea it's theſe who from <hi>internal Motives</hi> can find it eaſy to lay their deareſt things at the ſtake, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Truth and Glory of Chriſt in the Land they belong to, and without reſpect to private intereſt lay themſelves in the way of a publick ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard

            <p>But ſince the publick State of things this day is ſuch as ſeems, to controul any confidence or hope for anſwering ſuch a <hi>call, to ſtand in the breach of ſo trying and hazardous a time,</hi> I would ſpeak a few things in the <hi>third place,</hi> which may put ſome more then ordinare weight of this <hi>call</hi> on our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. 1. That as it's eaſy for the Lord to raiſe
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:31860:81"/> and excite the ſpirits of men to ſuch <hi>duties,</hi> as in the way of humane reaſon would ſeem wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable; ſo can it not be found in the <hi>Records of times past,</hi> that where grace did interpoſe in any ſingular way <hi>to prevent Judgment,</hi> and for recovering of a Church in ſome extreme caſe, but there hath alſo been ſomething more extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar then at other times, in the acting forth and excitment of ſome <hi>inſtruments,</hi> to appear for God with a more Heroick motion on their ſpirits, then what hath been uſual, and when he hath had a <hi>ſaving work</hi> and <hi>deſign</hi> to accomplish, then <hi>Saviours have come upon Mount Zion Obad v:</hi> 21.</p>
            <p>2. If it be a ſerious buſineſs to <hi>diſcern the times,</hi> we are in with reſpect to the <hi>publick State of theſe Nations,</hi> the voice of this <hi>call</hi> might then ly near our ſpirits, ſince if we <hi>turn our eyes back,</hi> it is demonſtrably evident that the Lord hath not dealt ſo with any <hi>Nation of the Gentiles</hi> under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> as with the <hi>Iſle of Britain,</hi> both as to eminent experiments of Providence, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation of Grace and meaſures of light eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince it's recovery from the Power of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Darkneſs; ſo as it is not ſtrange that he hath gone forth in a more ſingular way of Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure therewith then other <hi>Churches,</hi> and tho <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is new under the Sun as Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, yet there may be ſeen ſome thing peculiar and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing as to the way and Actings of Providence there in this age, as will not be eaſy for the moſt
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:31860:82"/> judicious <hi>Obſervers,</hi> to find a precedent for the ſame; and if we now conſider the <hi>preſent time,</hi> as things are ſtated after ſuch reſolute oppoſitions to the voice of theſe <hi>times past,</hi> and when no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes of Providence hath yet put any ſtop to a growing hight of <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> as may bee too viſible there; yea that it's ſure, God will not loſe his Work or Intent in the great expence he hath been at for <hi>reclaiming this Generation,</hi> it may be then without a <hi>Prophetick Light</hi> ſeen that ſomething very <hi>extraordinar is near,</hi> either in the way of <hi>Judgment</hi> or <hi>Mercy;</hi> ſo as this ſervice and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the preſent <hi>Breach</hi> ſeems to be in another manner call'd for bejond that of an ordinare day, when there is yet room, and the door of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion not abſolutely shut; but if this ſeem light, it will be found that the longeſt meaſure of <hi>divine Patience</hi> will come to a <hi>Year and a Day at laſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It is ſure and unqueſtionable alſo, that the anſwering of this call, is the alone way to have <hi>God intereſſed in the publick State and Concerns of Britain</hi> in the preſent day, before whom all <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are as nothing,</hi> and the greateſt <hi>Train of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Cauſes,</hi> when their furtheſt ſtrength and activity is put forth, of no weight, when he wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thdrawes his influence as <hi>Job 7: 8. thy eyes are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and I am not.</hi> It may be matter of ſerious remark, that in this late time ſomething more then ordinare hath appeared in the <hi>French ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtrength,</hi> and tho on principles of reaſon
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:31860:82"/> the Power of ſuch an Adverſary ſhould not be ſuch matter of fear, when an unuſual concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of means is to ſtem ſuch a tide, and under the conduct of ſo <hi>Wiſe and Heroick a Leader;</hi> yet on the other hand, <hi>Ashur the rod of my anger Iſay 10: 5 is a formidable Party;</hi> and it s a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning caſe when the ſecurity and intereſt of a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> ſtands more by a <hi>permiſſive Providence,</hi> and ſingular longſuffering of God, then by <hi>promiſe.</hi> The diſcovery of <hi>hid Plots and Contrivances against the Government</hi> hath been of late in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner remarkable, but oh! there is one <hi>Plot,</hi> which is of ane other nature, to be above all fear'd, that's caried on not in the <hi>dark,</hi> but in the <hi>publick light,</hi> to betray theſe <hi>Nations</hi> to the Common Adverſary, it is ſuch a <hi>Plot, as was betwixt Balak and Balaäm, to divide Iſraël from God,</hi> that their ſtrength might depart from them, when once there is a ſad departure from him; and it's ſure theſe, who ever are intereſſed herein, hath the moſt active concurrence to weaken, and bring low the <hi>Politick Body of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> to haſten on a diſmal night, and advance the intereſt and ſtrength of viſible Adverſaries: But if there be no ſuitable appearance in this day, to <hi>counteract ſo diſmal a Plot,</hi> and the growing ſtrength of ſuch a <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> herein, there may be then too juſt cauſe for theſe of the moſt ſerious ſpirit, to long to have their <hi>part acted, and be gone off the ſtage</hi> ere they ſee the dreadful <hi>Effects</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:31860:83"/> hereof: and what ever advantage be of <hi>external means,</hi> it might be too eaſy then to judge of future things, where an inordinate reſpect to men, and a low regard to keep in with God, is one of the publick ſigns of the time we are in. I know it's no eaſy thing to improve the <hi>Providences of times past,</hi> that are at any diſtance from us, or to bring them home by a juſt <hi>application</hi> to the <hi>preſent day,</hi> and to compare what we now ſee of the Way and Workings of God, with what hath already paſt in theſe <hi>late Years,</hi> but if this were more impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and underſtood, there might be another view and diſcerning of the <hi>times we are in.</hi> and <hi>what of</hi> the <hi>night</hi> now it is: we have ſeen in ſome ſingular way, the riſing and falling of humane intereſts ſo contrare to humane reaſon and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations, as might tend fully to clear from what hand they came, and to what Iſſue they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, we have ſeen ſuch <hi>Revolutions,</hi> which the <hi>Churches of Britain</hi> hath gone thorough, and hath paſt over the ſame, as ſeem yet little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and it muſt be a perverſe and falſe Judgment, if it be ſuppoſed that we have no more to do herewith, but a naked remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of ſuch things in the matter of Fact, and what was mens way and part therein. But that I may come more near on this <hi>Subject,</hi> there are ſome things that need to be further underſtood thereon.</p>
            <p>1. That it's ſure when ſuch a <hi>Gape</hi> this day is
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:31860:83"/> lying open betwixt us and <hi>divine Wrath,</hi> there can be no ſtanding herein without a ſerious <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Work with God</hi> by immediate addreſſes, when its unexpreſſible what a mighty efficacy this hath on the World, and the great changes thereof, and how far he hath ſubjected the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Nations to the Prayers of the Saints.</hi> It is a hopeful ſign when <hi>Rulers and Magiſtrates do call and excite a Nation to publick faſting and prayer,</hi> but in the ordinare way it's followed this day, upon ſo extraordinare an application to the Majeſty of God, it may be juſt matter of fear, if ſuch eſſential requiſites be not concurrent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. 1. That the ſame <hi>Authority and Power</hi> be interpoſed for a ſerious and impartial Inquiry as to <hi>National Sins,</hi> which are moſt prevalent in the time, where the current of the multitude runs, and hath the loudeſt cry to <hi>Heaven;</hi> ſince other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a ſolemn addreſs of this kind might bear a ſad evidence of <hi>Atheiſm and Impiety,</hi> to ſuit <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Deliverances and Protection,</hi> and that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God would be <hi>with us,</hi> and propitious to us for the publick <hi>State of the Nation,</hi> whilſt we are not <hi>with him,</hi> yea that he would not forſake us, whilſt our forſaking him is ſo viſible, which is in effect to plead that the moſt <hi>ſettled &amp; unalterable eſtablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his truth</hi> be made void, and reſcinded for our ſake; yea can another return be expected in ſuch a caſe then what is <hi>Ezech.</hi> 14: 4. 2. That ſomething then upon ſo extraordinare an addreſs
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:31860:84"/> to Heaven, might be deſigned by <hi>publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in a promiſſary way</hi> to be made practicable, as ſould tend to a more viſible reſolute withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the growing ſtrength of ſuch <hi>National evils,</hi> and may thus bear a publick teſtimony and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance againſt them from ſuch who ſtand under ſo high a truſt unto God for this end.</p>
            <p>2. Where this great <hi>ſervice</hi> is taken to heart for <hi>ſtanding in the gape this day</hi> before God, there needs alſo ſome clear diſcerning of the <hi>end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Providence, in theſe aſtonishing ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It may be thus clearly ſeen, if our ſpirits were more deeply lett forth on ſuch a <hi>ſtudy,</hi> that the <hi>ſtrength of our day,</hi> yea the ſtanding and ſecurity of the <hi>publick ſtate of theſe Nations,</hi> does aſſuredly ly in a reſolute concurrence, with this <hi>great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Lord;</hi> ſo as otherwiſe there can be no <hi>ſtanding in the breach before him,</hi> to <hi>turn away his wrath.</hi> But ſince this <hi>Subject,</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Right,</hi> and <hi>Kingdom of Jeſus Christ,</hi> over the <hi>Kingdoms of this Earth,</hi> is ſo ſtrange a myſtery to many in theſe times, and ſuch different thoughts and conceptions are hereof; as I have deſired to know the <hi>way of truth,</hi> on theſe ſure <hi>principles,</hi> and <hi>grounds,</hi> that I might have full reſt and ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to my own ſpirit herein; ſo I may ſay, that in the clearneſs of this <hi>light,</hi> I have found a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſtrengthning in the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> when with the furtheſt evidence it may be ſeen:</p>

There is one <hi>Reflection</hi> further hath affected my ſpirit upon this <hi>Controverſy,</hi> as to the <hi>juncture of time,</hi> when it is become now ſo contagious and prevalent, whilſt we are to <hi>pray, wait,</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> with aſſurance for the renting of the <hi>vail</hi> yet off many dark pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the earth, to make way for that <hi>higher Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſts Reign</hi> thereon, which shall be to the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:31860:99"/> 
               <hi>gentile Church as life from the dead;</hi> yea when it is drawing ſo near to that great Revolution of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, when <hi>Shem,</hi> and <hi>Japhet</hi> shall yet again meet in the ſame <hi>Tents;</hi> how ſo ſtrong a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy is on foot to oppoſe the ſame, and to shut any door whither for <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Pagans,</hi> to enter at upon the Chriſtian Faith, but where they find ſo venerable a thing, as <hi>reaſon,</hi> ſtanding in their way to tell them, that the moſt <hi>eſſential part of Chriſtianity</hi> is incompatible therewith, &amp; that they muſt ſubject themſelves to the authority of <hi>humane Jndgment,</hi> and not to <hi>God,</hi> if they deſign to be <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> It is a <hi>famous paſſage,</hi> I muſt relate here of that great <hi>Jewish Council,</hi> held in <hi>Octob.</hi> 
               <q>1650. in the plain of <hi>Ageda,</hi> 30 leagues from <hi>Buda</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> to ſearch the Scripture concerning the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and the truth of the New Teſtament, where after ſeven dayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate about the ſame, and not a few Arguments offered from their continued deſolation and captivity ſince the time of Chriſt; ſome Popish Deputies at laſt were admit, who in ſtead of promoting the Chriſtian Faith, preſſed them to believe the Worſhip of the Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> upon which that great Aſſembly broke up in a tumult, crying no Chriſt, no Images, no Woman God, and caſt duſt on their heads, upon ſo irrational a Blaſphemy: It is true, ſome of the Rabbies then, did much deſire Proteſtant Divines to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:31860:100"/> have met with them, but that the Pope and Emperor had joined to shut them wholly out, tho thouſands of Strangers were then preſent at a meeting of ſo great expectation, of the Jews coming in to the Chriſtian Faith; but</q> I mention it for this end, what a cry would that have made, if they had been told of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and dependent God, &amp; to ſubject themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves here to the greateſt contradictions to Reaſon.</p>
            <p>5. I shall now in the cloſe but <hi>add</hi> this further, what should be ſpecially expected upon the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate of <hi>Christs viſible Kingdom in the World,</hi> that as theſe Fogs &amp; Miſts which have been raiſed upon the <hi>authority of his truth,</hi> will be then quikly diſpelled, ſo is there a <hi>higher Tribute</hi> to be given into him of <hi>the Glory of his Works, and the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goings of his Providence about the Church</hi> in theſe <hi>last times.</hi> I know, the work and buſines of this day lyes not here, or in deſigns of that nature, but it were well if much of that which makes the greateſt noiſe this day in the way of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> had its room filled with ſo choiſe a <hi>ſtudy</hi> as this is, tho it is indeed one of the peculiar en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of the Spirit of God, given to ſome more eminently then others, to be <hi>skilled</hi> in the <hi>Methods and Deeps of Providence,</hi> and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand aright how the <hi>Work of God</hi> lyes towards the <hi>Church,</hi> and his deſigns therein, according to theſe diſcoveries given of the ſame in his Word, and what <hi>watch of the night</hi> we are now
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:31860:100"/> under; but on this <hi>Head,</hi> I ſhall ſpeak to a few <hi>grounds,</hi> whereon this <hi>Tribute to the declarative Glory of God, from his great Works of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence about his Church,</hi> will in another manner be rendred to him then heretofore.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe it is ſurely in this way of his <hi>great and extraordinar Works,</hi> that the Lord does deſign a more eminent diſcovery of himſelf, then in all theſe times that are hitherto paſt, and will thus enter his Church on that <hi>brightneſs and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of his ſecond coming,</hi> which belongs to the <hi>last ages;</hi> when his going forth in the greatneſs of his ſtrength will be with that evidence, as shall ſeaſe the World with fear and aſtonishment; and when he is in another manner to glorify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his People, then was formerly in theſe <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering times,</hi> which are now <hi>past,</hi> wherein his Glory was to shine forth in the eminency of the <hi>paſſive graces of his ſpirit;</hi> for now is the <hi>Myſtery of God,</hi> in what yet remains thereof to be fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, in another way to take place, as shall call the Generation that's coming up to ſuch an <hi>obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and admiring Work</hi> of the great Acts of God, that may need a more then ordinare meaſure of grace to anſwer the ſame: but we muſt look for <hi>great things of Judgment,</hi> coming on, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, as well as of <hi>mercy,</hi> the <hi>Vyalls of divine Wrath, and last Plagues,</hi> are but in part poured out, wherein the appearance of God will be with much terror to the World, and that laſt
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:31860:101"/> Triumph of his Juſtice within time, will not be of ane ordinare kind; we are to expect great <hi>sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of the Nations,</hi> and times of <hi>breaking down,</hi> as well as of <hi>building up,</hi> which are yet to come, and drawing near.</p>
            <p>II. Becauſe we are entred on theſe <hi>times,</hi> when the Lord is in a more ſingular way then hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to put the whole Generation of his People, on that <hi>part of Divinity,</hi> and the ſtudy thereof, which relates to his <hi>Works,</hi> and that great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of <hi>Providence</hi> about his Church; when the <hi>Key</hi> shall then be put in their hand for opening up, and a more full underſtanding the way of the Lord in theſe <hi>times past</hi> under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This is indeed a weighty part of <hi>Divinity,</hi> which is reſerved to the <hi>latter times</hi> in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections thereof, and theſe higher improvements, to be made on that bleſſed <hi>ſtudy,</hi> then was attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in former ages, when his work now is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a more <hi>full point.</hi> It hath been remarkably the buſineſs of this age, to make a more accurate ſearch, and ſome greater diſcovery upon <hi>natural cauſes,</hi> and the workings thereof, but I doubt not, that ere long the inquiſitive World, shall be in another manner awaked, and their <hi>Inquiries</hi> run in a higher channel above all <hi>ſecond cauſes,</hi> to ſee and admire the <hi>great Acts of Providence,</hi> in the <hi>Divinity</hi> thereof, and not what is <hi>humane</hi> therein, but as they are by way of Eminency the <hi>Works of God,</hi> in the brightneſs of his immediate
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:31860:101"/> appearance in the ſame. It is one of the diſmal ſigns of the preſent time, how much the ſpirits of men are at work to darken ſo far, as poſſible the moſt eminent <hi>Diſcoveries of God in his Works,</hi> and in the moſt extraordinare revolutions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affairs, as if they would ſet bounds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to him, according to the courſe and order of ſecond cauſes, and ſubject, both the truth of his <hi>Word</hi> and his <hi>Works</hi> to the comprehenſion of their <hi>reaſon,</hi> tho ſome civil reſpect, they will give, and the name of his being the <hi>prime cauſe,</hi> but shut their eyes on what is more extraordinar and ſolemne in any piece of his work. I would yet point at ſome <hi>ſpecial Heads,</hi> that belong to this choiſe part of <hi>Divinity,</hi> which we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, will in another manner be opened up, and I deſire to rejoice in the hope hereof. 1. As to theſe more <hi>ſingular caſes of Providence,</hi> which hath been in the Churches courſe, ſince her <hi>first tranſlation</hi> from the <hi>Jews</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> with the isſue and conſequences thereof, contrare to the rules or principles of natural reaſon, which is ane Inquiry to be more fully improven, then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath been attained this way; when men shall ſee the <hi>end of the Lord</hi> herein, with ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence as shall tend to <hi>clear all bygones</hi> in his work. 2. Theſe remarkable <hi>Periods</hi> of time, wherein the <hi>Prophetical Part of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> hath been ſucceſſively brought forth in their proper <hi>Seaſon,</hi> as was foretold, is yet to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:31860:102"/> have the <hi>ſeall</hi> more fully taken off, and that <hi>vaill,</hi> which was over them, ſo as it shall be clear and eaſy to ſee how the Lord hath not only kept his Word and Truth to his Church, but hath kept theſe times alſo exactly, to which ſuch great <hi>events of Providence</hi> did relate. 3. There is a greater diſcovery yet to be made, then hath been hitherto, how the <hi>Church hath been led in a right way,</hi> and by a ſtraight <hi>line</hi> in her whole courſe, through that <hi>long,</hi> and <hi>terrible Wilderneſs,</hi> which she was to paſs, under the diſpenſation of the Gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; and what eminent <hi>ſervices</hi> the Saints have been put on in theſe ſtrange meaſures of their <hi>warefare,</hi> which was then allotted to them, and in theit <hi>overcoming work</hi> thereby; yea what a higher Triumph our <hi>bleſſed Redeemer</hi> hath had in the <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> of his People in ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal a time, then in any external flourishing ſtate of his Church, ſo as it might be ſaid it was then <hi>day,</hi> as to the <hi>preſence of his ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>irreſiſtable efficacy of his truth</hi> on his followers, when it ſeemed otherwiſe as the darknes of <hi>midnight.</hi> 4. There belongs to this part of <hi>Divinity,</hi> ſome higher breaking up of light, yet to be made on that Myſtery of the <hi>Communion of the Saints here</hi> with other, in the <hi>way of providence,</hi> and what a joint intereſt they have herein, as to what hath been more ſingular in the Lords way, and diſpoſal about others of his People: we have little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood what ane inriching <hi>trade,</hi> we might drive
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:31860:102"/> upon that <hi>ſtock</hi> of theſe <hi>ancient experiments</hi> of Chriſtians in following the Lord, and theſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent tryalls they have made of the truth, who hath in ages paſt gone before, and what a <hi>Pawn</hi> is thus put in our hand, for a further ſtrengthning in the Faith; yea what publick intereſt thus the whole <hi>Church of Christ</hi> hath, in ſome eminent acts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence about particular Chriſtians, which in the import and greatneſs thereof was not given for themſelf only, but as a publick concern to the whole <hi>Generation,</hi> that ſeek after God in their day, and for the times to come, according to that <hi>Pſal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I muſt <hi>add,</hi> one great improvement of this ſpecial <hi>Head of Divinity,</hi> which will yet be above the meaſures of times paſt, in the extent of that <hi>Reference,</hi> and <hi>Appeal,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> in behalf of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs of God,</hi> for what he hath ſpoken and promiſed to his Church; and is that <hi>Tribute of praiſe,</hi> which in a higher degree is to be payed in to him, now when it's ſo near to the cloſe of time, then by that great teſtimony of <hi>Joshua</hi> 25: 14. how <hi>not one thing had fail'd of all the good things the Lord had then ſpoken in behalf of his Church, but had fully taken place,</hi> and was the ſame <hi>Appeal,</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi> made I. <hi>Kings</hi> 8: 56. for this with a higher glory and evidence is to be the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the latter days, when it's drawing near to that magnificent cloſe and period of <hi>Prophetick

            <p>III. But for a further clearing of this <hi>Subject,</hi> ſince the <hi>Glory of the Kingdom of Christ</hi> is ſo near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern'd in the diſcovery and entertainment of his <hi>Works,</hi> in the day thereof, and now when a more eminent appearance thereof is near, that Kingdoms and Nations in their <hi>Complex Body,</hi> ſhall in a more ſolemn way be the <hi>Lords;</hi> It ſhould be expected that the <hi>return</hi> and <hi>oblation of praiſe</hi>

               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:31860:104"/> which are yet to be brought forth as cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in an other way be expected. But on this <hi>Subject</hi> I would humbly offer ſome few reflections, which ſhould be matter of a ſerious regard.</p>
            <p>1. That as its highly becoming, on ſome <hi>eminent piece of the Work of God,</hi> or publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, for a Nation or State to have <hi>ſolemn and publick returns of thankfulnes</hi> to him thereon; yet is it ſtrange how ſo little regard should thus be to have the greatnes of any ſuch mercy <hi>ſought out,</hi> and the ſame <hi>publick care extended,</hi> for keeping up a <hi>venerable remembrance</hi> thereof, ſo that ſuch a ſervice of <hi>Gratitude</hi> be not bounded with the tranſient work of a day, ſince otherways it is a moſt <hi>eſſential want,</hi> and with holding a proper and important part of that <hi>Tribute,</hi> which is due into God herein, for there can be no ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table regard to ſerve the end of ſuch <hi>Providences,</hi> and what was ſo ſtraitly injoined of the Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> which was the <hi>Churches</hi> continued practice there; yea of the ſame <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>perpetual uſe</hi> in all after times, if it should not be ſtill a <hi>publick trust</hi> under the furtheſt <hi>humane care</hi> to promote the ſame, tho <hi>divine Record and Hiſtory</hi> for this intent does now ceaſe.</p>
            <p>2. But as this hath ane unqueſtionable <hi>tye on Churches,</hi> and a <hi>Chriſtian State</hi> to deſign the moſt honourable reſpect, and entertainment of the <hi>great Acts of God</hi> in their day, and is made their <hi>proper talent</hi> to anſwer to; ſo does a juſt exonera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:31860:104"/> herein, call for the moſt <hi>exact ſcrutiny</hi> and <hi>ſearch</hi> on the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>evidence</hi> thereof, on which the weight, and credit of this <hi>ſervice</hi> does ſo far depend, to cauſe a more <hi>full aſſent,</hi> by theſe who come after to ſuch a teſtimony, that theſe rare Providences, wherein the Lord did thus make himſelf known, were not only in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time <hi>ſought out,</hi> and enquired unto, under their <hi>proper círcumſtances,</hi> but by ſuch of greateſt weight, and advantage, for a work of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; whoſe ſincerity and judiciousneſs might be convincing, and the integrity of ſuch ane <hi>Intent,</hi> cleared from any partial reſpect or end, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennerly for <hi>exalting the Majeſty of God,</hi> and ſtrengthning men in the <hi>Faith,</hi> by ſo great a <hi>ſeal to his Truth,</hi> and for the intereſt of the <hi>Poſterity;</hi> yea wherein theſe who in ſome leſſer differences did not fully meet in the ſame <hi>Judgment,</hi> yet might intirely unite, in ſuch a <hi>ſervice</hi> and <hi>teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> as this.</p>
            <p>3. Where the Lord makes himſelf known in more <hi>illuſtrious acts of his power,</hi> as may be called <hi>Magnalia Dei,</hi> to ſome <hi>particular Nation,</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> beſide others, who herein are in a more then ordinare way intereſſed; it might ſeem e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, and anſwer to the higheſt reaſon, they ſould be of that value, as to be entred on a <hi>National Record,</hi> and have that concurrence of <hi>humane authority,</hi> to make the evidence hereof as <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick,</hi> as the <hi>publick deeds,</hi> or <hi>rights,</hi> which

               </gap>t, which it might have in after times; but I have confidence, that a higher ſervice of this kind in the improvement of ſo great a <hi>Talent</hi> for the honor of God, does yet wait on the <hi>Church,</hi> &amp; ſucceeding race, as ſhall tend to bring up what hath been detain'd of ſuch a rent and tribute of praiſe, yea that theſe whoſe <hi>Lot</hi> ſhall be in the dayes that are now coming, and fall in with the growing ſtate and glory of the Kingdom of Chriſt to ſee theſe things, which will exceed the thoughts and faith of this day herein, ſhall ſee and enjoy ſuch <hi>Records</hi> of theſe times, where the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:31860:106"/> great intent ſhall be of that kind <hi>Revel. 15: 3.

            <p>4. It is on this <hi>Subject,</hi> I muſt <hi>add</hi> further, that a <hi>traditional conveyance</hi> of more ſpecial and momentous things of Providence, might be of much uſe, were it ſuitably improven, to have a remembrance thereof continued in a <hi>Family Line</hi> and <hi>Relation,</hi> which is one peculiar way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>preſent Generation</hi> might declare the truth and faithfulneſs of God to the <hi>next.</hi> It is true, there is no ſerious Chriſtian, but is thus ſiſted, and accountable on ſuch a ſervice to put to his <hi>ſeall,</hi> by ſome explicit perſonal teſtimony, that God is true, upon his tryall hereof, and moſt ſpecially to improve that ſeaſon, when it is near to the <hi>cloſe and shutting up of time,</hi> that with his laſt and dying breath he might bear the ſame wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the truth of Chriſt, and to the advantage and excellency of his way and ſervice, which he did in the whole courſe of his life paſt, and of that joy, complacence &amp; aſſurance of mind, which theſe have found, and now hath in the way of truth; but there is ſomething more peculiar in this <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> to be underſtood, with reſpect to theſe to whom things in a more ſingular manner
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:31860:107"/> hath been allotted then to other Chriſtians, in the way of Providence, and hath in the <hi>Record</hi> and <hi>Journal</hi> of their life had more extraordinar <hi>Remarks</hi> and <hi>Confirmations</hi> from the Lord, as gives higher acceſs to this ſervice, and adds to the value of ſuch a Teſtimony. I would offer but a few thoughts on ſuch a <hi>Head,</hi> which may poſſibly ſeem a ſtrange and dark thing to ſome: 1. It was once for a long time that the <hi>Series of the Church</hi> was kept up in a <hi>Family Line</hi> from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to the 12 <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and what a rare courſe and conduct of Providence was thus tranſmit to after times, which is ſo great ane intereſt, and treaſure to this day, and tho that <hi>convoyance</hi> was by an infallible ſpirit, yet is this ſo far <hi>exemplary</hi> thereby, for ſuch a confirmatory witneſs, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Chriſtians, to the truth, when it comes to their <hi>last improvement of time,</hi> and of what hath been more ſignal and eminent in the Lords deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, that it should be one of the choiſeſt <hi>Legacies</hi> they could be queath to their <hi>Relations,</hi> yea a ſingular mean to have Religion thus kept alive in a more venerable reſpect thereto in a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily State,</hi> and to fix ſtronger engagements to the way of God, on their <hi>ſurviving Friends.</hi> 2. I hope there be no ſerious diſcerning Chriſtian, but hath ſome more <hi>ſelect Obſervations of their life,</hi> and what hath been moſt remarkable in the courſe of Providence towards them, layd up, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of which might be of <hi>ſingular uſe,</hi> beſides
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:31860:107"/> their own perſonal inter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſt therein, to a further e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtablishment of others in the way of truth; tho any improvement of that kind needs much <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian prudence and ſobriety</hi> to qualify the ſame; yea, were this ſuitably deſigned in ſuch diſmal times, we are now fall'n in, what acceſs might private Chriſtians have, theſe ſpecially who have gone through more extrao<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h delivered my ſoul out of all diſtreſs:</hi> this I humbly judge falleth in as the laſt and peculiar ſervice of a Chriſtian, when it hath the advantage to be more valuable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing to others, then in any other time of their life, &amp; were a thing highly deſirable, that a <hi>work of this kind</hi> should be ſuitably prepared, to prevent a ſurpriſal of death, &amp; going ſilent off the <hi>ſtage,</hi> which hath been the lott of theſe who have shin'd moſt
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:31860:108"/> brightly thereon; and as it ſurely hath the moſt opportune ſeaſon in the <hi>last Scene of a Chriſtians Work,</hi> ſo may it be yet more deſigned and regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the <hi>last ages of time,</hi> when thete is to be expected ſuch <hi>Teſtimonies for God,</hi> and to the <hi>Glory of his Truth,</hi> as will much exceed the <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar Standard</hi> of theſe times paſt, and we are now in. The full ſenſe of that <hi>Scripture John</hi> 3: 33. should have a great weight herein, <hi>he that hath received his Teſtimony, hath ſett to his ſeall that God is true,</hi> where there is a peculiar <hi>debt,</hi> and <hi>trust</hi> on the one hand that is put on ſuch, who hath the truth and teſtimony of God conſign'd for tryall of the ſame; and a <hi>diſcharge</hi> thereof, which on the other hand they ſtand accountable for <hi>put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to their ſeall that God is true,</hi> which is the moſt ſolemn way of a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> before men; tho ſome may be thus in a ſpecial manner ſtated by higher engagements to fanctify God before others, and when ſome more ſingular paſſages of Providence comes under ſuch a witneſs and ſeall as a <hi>diſtinct part of a Chriſtians Teſtament</hi> in his parting with time, it brings the ſtrongeſt evidence that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane teſtimony can poſſibly have for conveyance of the ſame.</p>
